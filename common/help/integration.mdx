## Introduction

This guide explains how to integrate a GUI or Web App to Upstash using OAuth 2.0 protocol.
So users can connect their Upstash account then they can manage their Upstash resources inside the GUI/Web App.

Upstash supports OAuth 2.0 the industry-standard protocol for authorization.
This guide explains how to integrate Upstash OAuth 2.0 flow for the
authorization and resource management. Upstash uses Auth0 for the
authentication.

<Info>
  Before starting development to integrate Upstash into your product, please
  send an email to partnerships@upstash.com for further assistance and guidance.

## Use Cases - Examples

Products that utilize Redis, Kafka, or QStash are invited to join our esteemed partner program.
Consider, for instance, a Redis GUI—a tool enabling users to seamlessly navigate their Redis instances.
Through seamless integration, users gain the ability to effortlessly explore Upstash resources and even establish new databases within the GUI application.

Upstash has seamlessly [integrated with Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-database-integration-with-upstash/), marking a successful collaboration.
As a result of this integration, Cloudflare users now have the capability to effortlessly link their Upstash account with Cloudflare Workers, enabling them to seamlessly harness Upstash resources within their worker environments.


## General Flow (User Perspective - High Level)

1. User will click `Connect Upstash` button in GUI/Web App ,
2. The app will initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow, which will open a new browser page
   displaying the `Upstash Login Page`.
3. Users will either log in or sign up for their Upstash account.
4. Browser window will be redirected to `Your account has been connected` Page
   then browser window will automatically close.
5. After the user returns to the Web/GUI Application, they will see that their
   Upstash Account is now connected.

## Technical Design (SPA - Regular Web Application)

1. Users click `Connect Upstash` button from Web App.
2. Web App initiate Upstash OAuth 2.0 flow. Web App can use
   [Auth0 native libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries).

<Note>
  Please reach partnerships@upstash.com to receive client id and callback url.
</Note>

3. After user returns from OAuth 2.0 flow then web app will have JWT token. Web
   App can generate Developer Api key:

```bash
curl https://api.upstash.com/apikey \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "name" : "APPNAME_API_KEY_TIMESTAMP" }'
```

4. Web App need to save Developer Api Key to the backend.

## Technical Design ( GUI Apps )

</Frame>

1. Users click `Connect Upstash` button from GUI
2. App starts listening `localhost:3000`
3. App will open new browser:

```
https://auth.upstash.com/authorize?response_type=code&audience=upstash-api&scope=offline_access&client_id=XXXXXXXXXX&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000
```

<Note>Please reach partnerships@upstash.com to receive client id.</Note>

4. After user authenticated Auth0 will redirect user to
   `localhost:3000/?code=XXXXXX`
5. APP can return some nice html response when Auth0 returns to `localhost:3000`

6. After getting `code` parameter from the URL query, GUI App will make http
   call to the Auth0 code exchange api. Example CURL request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://auth.upstash.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=authorization_code --data audience=upstash-api' \
  --data 'client_id=XXXXXXXXXXX' \
  --data 'code=XXXXXXXXXXXX' \
  --data 'redirect_uri=localhost:3000'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "XXXXXXXXXX",
  "refresh_token": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
  "scope": "offline_access",
  "expires_in": 172800,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

7. After 6th Step the response will include `access_token`, it has 3 days TTL.
   GUI App will call Upstash API to get a developer api key:

```bash
curl https://api.upstash.com/apikey -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_KEY" -d '{ "name" : "APPNAME_API_KEY_TIMESTAMP" }'
```

8. GUI App will save Developer Api key locally. Then GUI App can call any
   Upstash Developer API [developer.upstash.com/](http://developer.upstash.com/)

## Managing Resources

After obtaining Upstash Developer Api key, App can call Upstash API. For example
[Create Database](https://developer.upstash.com/#create-database-global),
[List Database](https://developer.upstash.com/#list-databases)

App can ask user region information and name of the database then can call
Create Database API.

Example CURL request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.upstash.com/v2/redis/database \
  -u 'EMAIL:API_KEY' \
  -d '{"name":"myredis", "region":"global", "primary_region":"us-east-1", "read_regions":["us-west-1","us-west-2"], "tls": true}'
```
