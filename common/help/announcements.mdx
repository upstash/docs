Removal of GraphQL API and edge caching (Redis) (October 1, 2022) These two
features have been already deprecated. We are planning to deactivate them
completely on November 1st. We recommend use of REST API to replace GraphQL API
and Global databases instead of Edge caching.

Removal of strong consistency (Redis) (October 1, 2022) Upstash supported Strong
Consistency mode for the single region databases. We decided to deprecate this
feature because its effect on latency started to conflict with the performance
expectations of Redis use cases. Moreover, we improved the consistency of
replication to guarantee Read-Your-Writes consistency. Strong consistency will
be disabled on existing databases on November 1st.

#### Redis pay-as-you-go usage cap (October 1, 2022)

We are increasing the max usage cap to \$160 from \$120 as of October 1st. This
update is needed because of the increasing infrastructure cost due to
replicating all databases to multiple instances. After your database exceeds the
max usage cost, your database might be rate limited.

#### Replication is enabled (Sep 29, 2022)

All new and existing paid databases will be replicated to multiple replicas.
Replication enables high availability in case of system and infrastructure
failures. Starting from October 1st, we will gradually upgrade all databases
without downtime. Free databases will stay single replica.

database owners will be notified via email.

Support for AWS Tokyo Region was the most requested feature by our users. Now
our users can create their database in AWS Asia Pacific (Tokyo) region
(ap-northeast-1). In addition to Japan, Upstash is available in the regions
us-west-1, us-east-1, eu-west-1.

Click [here](https://console.upstash.com) to start your database for free.

#### Vercel Integration (February 22, 2021)

Upstash&Vercel integration has been released. Now you are able to integrate
Upstash to your project easily. We believe Upstash is the perfect database for
your applications thanks to its:

- Low latency data
- Per request pricing
- Durable storage
- Ease of use

Below are the resources about the integration:

See [how to guide](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/howto/vercelintegration).
