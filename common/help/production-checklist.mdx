title: Production Checklist
---

This checklist provides essential recommendations for securing and optimizing your Upstash databases for production workloads.

## Security Features

### Enable Prod Pack
Prod Pack provides enterprise-grade security and monitoring features:

- 99.99% uptime SLA
- SOC-2 Type 2 report available
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Encryption at Rest
- Advanced monitoring (Prometheus, Datadog)
- High availability for read regions

<Note>
  Prod Pack is available as a $200/month add-on per database for all paid plans except Free tier.
</Note>

### Enable Credential Protection
Protect your database credentials (Prod Pack feature):

- Credentials are never stored in Upstash infrastructure
- Credentials are displayed only once during enablement
- Console features requiring database access are disabled

<Warning>
  Disabling this feature will permanently revoke current credentials and generate new ones.
</Warning>

### Configure IP Allowlist
Restrict database access to specific IP addresses:

- Available on all plans except Free tier
- Supports IPv4 addresses and CIDR blocks
- Multiple IP ranges can be configured

### Implement Redis ACL
Use Redis Access Control Lists to restrict user access:

- Create users with minimal required permissions
- Available for both TCP connections and REST API
- Use `ACL RESTTOKEN` command to generate REST tokens

### Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
Enable MFA on your Upstash account for enhanced security:

- Use your existing authentication provider (Google, GitHub, Amazon)
- Consider using a dedicated email/password account for production
- Force MFA for all team members to ensure consistent security
- Regularly review account access and team member permissions

### Secure Credential Management
Follow these best practices:

- Never hardcode credentials in your application code
- Use environment variables or secret management systems
- Reset passwords immediately if credentials are compromised
- Use Read-Only tokens for public-facing applications

## Network Security

### TLS Encryption
TLS is always enabled on Upstash Redis databases.

### VPC Peering (Enterprise)
Connect databases to your VPCs using private IP:

- Database becomes inaccessible from public networks
- Minimizes data transfer costs
- Available for Enterprise customers

## Monitoring & Observability

### Enable Advanced Monitoring
Prod Pack includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Prometheus integration
- Datadog integration
- Extended console metrics (up to one month)


## High Availability & Backup

### Enable Daily Backups
Configure automated daily backups for data protection:

- Available on all paid plans
- Backup retention up to 3 days with Prod Pack
- Hourly backups with customizable retention (Enterprise)

### Global Replication
For global applications, consider using Global Database:

- Distribute data across multiple regions
- Minimize latency for users worldwide
- Enhanced disaster recovery capabilities


## Compliance & Governance

### SOC-2 Compliance
Prod Pack and Enterprise plans include SOC-2 Type 2 compliance:

- Request SOC-2 report from [trust.upstash.com](https://trust.upstash.com/)
- Available for production workloads

### Enterprise Features
For enterprise customers:

- HIPAA compliance available
- SAML SSO integration
- Access logs available
- Custom resource allocation
