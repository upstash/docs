title: Uptime SLA
---

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") applies to Upstash databases with the Prod Pack add-on or Enterprise plans. It is clarified that this SLA is subject to the [terms of the Agreement](https://upstash.com/trust/terms.pdf), and does not derogate therefrom (capitalized terms, unless otherwise indicated herein, have the meaning specified in the Agreement).

To receive uptime SLA guarantees, you need to enable the Prod Pack add-on or be on an Enterprise plan for your database. Learn more about [Prod Pack and Enterprise features](/redis/overall/enterprise).

Upstash reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA by publishing updated
terms on its website, such change to be effective as of the date of publication.

### Uptime Guarantee

Upstash will use commercially reasonable efforts to make 
databases with Prod Pack add-on or Enterprise plans available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least **99.99%**.

In the event any of the services do not meet the SLA, you will be eligible to
receive a Service Credit as described below.

| Monthly Uptime Percentage                           | Service Credit Percentage |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Less than 99.99% but equal to or greater than 99.0% | 10%                       |
| Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0%  | 30%                       |
| Less than 95.0%                                     | 60%                       |

### SLA Credits

Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the monthly bill (excluding
one-time payments such as upfront payments) for the service in the affected
region that did not meet the SLA.

Uptime percentages are recorded and published in the
[Upstash Status Page](https://status.upstash.com).

To receive a Service Credit, you should submit a claim by sending an email to
[support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com). Your credit request should be
received by us before the end of the second billing cycle after the incident
occurred.

We will apply any service credits against future payments for the applicable
services. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card
you used. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment. A
Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the
applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service
Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.

### Getting Uptime SLA Coverage

To receive uptime SLA guarantees for your databases, you need to upgrade to either:

- **Prod Pack**: An add-on per database available to both pay-as-you-go and fixed-price plans
- **Enterprise Plan**: A per-account plan that covers all your databases

You can activate Prod Pack on the database details page in the console. For Enterprise plans, contact [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).
