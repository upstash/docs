title: Audit Logs
---

Audit logs gives you chronological set of activity records that have affected
your databases and Upstash account. You can see the list of all activities in a
single page. You can access your audit logs under `Account > Audit Logs` in your
console:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/auditlogs/audit.png" />
</Frame>

Here the `Source` column shows if the action has been called by console or via
an API key. `Entity` column gives you the name of the resource that had been
affected by the action. For example, when you delete a database, the name of the
database will be shown here. Also you can see the IP address which performed the
action.

## Security

You can track your audit logs to detect any unusual activity on account and
databases. When you suspect any security breach, you should delete the API key
related to suspicious activity and inform us emailing at
[support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com)

## Retention period

After the retention period, the audit logs are deleted. Retention period for
free databases is 7 days, for standard databases it is 30 days, for premium
databases it is one year.
