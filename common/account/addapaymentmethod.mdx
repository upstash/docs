1. Click on your profile at the top right.
2. Select  `Account` from the dropdown menu.
3. Navigate to the `Billing` tab.
4. On the screen, click the `Add Your Card` button.
5. Enter your name and credit card information in the following form:

You can enter multiple credit cards and set one of them as the default one. The
payments will be charged from the default credit card.

## Payment Security

Upstash does not store users' credit card information in its servers. We use
Stripe Inc payment processing company to handle payments. You can read more
