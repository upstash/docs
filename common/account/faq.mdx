## How can I delete my account?
You can delete your account from `Account` > `Settings` > `Delete Account`. You should first delete all your databases and clusters. After you delete your account, all your data and payment information will be deleted and you will not be able to recover it.

## How can I delete my credit card?
You can delete your credit card from `Account` > `Billing` page. However, you should first add a new credit card to be able to delete the existing one. If you want to delete all of your payment information, you should delete your account.

## How can I change my email address?
You can change your account e-mail address in `Account` > `Settings` page. In order to change your billing e-mail adress, please see `Account` > `Billing` page. If you encounter any issues, please contact us at [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) to change your email address.

## Can I set an upper spending limit, so I don't get surprises after an unexpected amount of high traffic?
On Pay as You Go model, you can set a budget for your Redis and Kafka instances. When your monthly cost reaches the max budget, we send an email to inform you and throttle your instance. You will not be charged beyond your set budget.

## What happens if my payment fails?

If a payment failure occurs, we will retry the payment three more times before suspending the account. During this time, you will receive email notifications about the payment failure. If the account is suspended, all resources in the account will be inaccessible. If you add a valid payment method after the account suspension, your account will be automatically unsuspended during the next payment attempt.

## What happens if I unsubscribe from AWS Marketplace but I don't have any other payment methods?

We send a warning email three times before suspending an account. If no valid payment method is added, we suspend the account. Once the account is suspended, all resources within the account will be inaccessible. If you add a valid payment method after the account suspension, your account will be automatically unsuspended during the next system check.
