title: Developer API
---

Using Upstash API, you can develop applications that can create and manage
Upstash databases and Upstash Vector Indexes. You can automate everything that
you can do in the console. To use developer API, you need to create an API key
in the console.

Note: The Developer API is only available to native Upstash accounts. Accounts created via third-party platforms like Vercel or Fly.io are not supported.

See [DevOps](/devops) for details.
