## Overview

Upstash Workflow lets you write **durable, reliable and performant serverless functions**. Get delivery guarantees, automatic retries on failure, scheduling and more without managing any infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Failure Resilience**: If your platform experiences a temporary outage, your workflow can pick up right where it left off. Upstash Workflows ensures that your application will continue, even when your environment is unstable.
- **Long-Running Executions on Time-Limited Platforms**: Run long-running REST endpoints, such as complex AI models or video processing tools, even on serverless platforms with strict time limits. 
- **Events with Wait/Notify Mechanism**: Create workflows that wait for external events before proceeding. Ideal for use cases like waiting for user input (e.g., clicking a confirmation email) or handling asynchronous notifications from external systems. 
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Run jobs at regular intervals with support for cron expressions. Perfect for recurring tasks like reminders, regular reports, or newsletters. [Set up scheduled jobs here](/workflow/howto/schedule).
- **Parallel Runs**: Start independent tasks in parallel and wait for them to finish simultaneously, reducing latency. [Read more about parallel runs here](/workflow/howto/parallel-runs).
- **Long Delays**: Need your code to “sleep” for days, weeks, or even months? Upstash Workflows supports long delays beyond the time limits imposed by serverless platforms.
- **Delivery Guarantees**: Upstash Workflows guarantees at-least-once delivery. Once a request is accepted, it will run—even if the hosting platform experiences interruptions. In the rare case of failure, the request is logged in a Dead Letter Queue, so you never lose track of critical events.
- **Cost Reduction for Serverless Environments**: Serverless platforms charge based on execution time. With Upstash Workflows, you can offload time-consuming, I/O-bound tasks from serverless platforms, reducing operational costs. [See cost reduction example here](https://image-gen-with-workflow.vercel.app/).
- **Rate Limiting (Coming Soon)**: Prevent overwhelming external services by configuring rate limits for your workflows. Control the maximum number of operations per second, and ensure that burst traffic is managed without dropping any calls.
- **Observability**: Monitor your application's steps with comprehensive insights. Filter events to see which functions succeeded, failed, retried, or stalled. [Learn more about observability here](/workflow/howto/monitor).

## Quickstarts

Workflow supports Next.js, Cloudflare Workers and [many more frameworks](/workflow/quickstarts/platforms).

## How it works

Upstash Workflow builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, _each step_ can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.

## Next.js code example

Let's see a practical implementation of Upstash Workflow using Next.js and customer onboarding as an example. See our [Next.js Quickstart](/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs) for a complete guide.

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { sendEmail } from "./emailUtils";

// Type-safety for starting our workflow
interface InitialData {
  userId: string
  email: string
  name: string
}

export const { POST } = serve<InitialData>(async (context) => {
  const { userId, email, name } = context.requestPayload;

  // Step 1: Send welcome email
  await context.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(email, "Welcome to our service!");
  });

  // Step 2: Wait for 3 days (in seconds)
  await context.sleep("sleep-until-follow-up", 60 * 60 * 24 * 3);

  // Step 3: AI-generate personalized follow-up message
  const aiResponse = await context.call(
    "generate-personalized-message",
    "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    "POST",
    {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are an assistant creating personalized follow-up messages." },
        { role: "user", content: `Create a short, friendly follow-up message for ${name} who joined our service 3 days ago.` }
      ]
    },
    { headers: { ... } }
  );

  const personalizedMessage = aiResponse.choices[0].message.content;

  // Step 4: Send personalized follow-up email
  await context.run("send-follow-up-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(email, personalizedMessage);
  });
});
```

<Tip>
  Any HTTP request using `context.call`, like the AI-generation above, does not
  count towards your function's execution time and does not increase your
  serverless bill. It can also run for up to 2 hours, completely bypassing any
  platform-specific function timeouts.
</Tip>

The above example should give you a rough idea of how a workflow looks in code. For step-by-step instructions on setting up your first workflow with images along the way, see our [Next.js Quickstart](/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs).
