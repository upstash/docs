## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Failure Resilience"
    icon="shield"
  >
    If your platform experiences a temporary outage, your workflow can pick up right where it left off, ensuring stability even in unstable environments.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Long-Running Executions"
    icon="clock"
  >
    Run long-running REST endpoints, such as complex AI models or video processing tools, even on serverless platforms with strict time limits.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Events with Wait/Notify Mechanism"
    icon="bell"
  >
    Create workflows that wait for external events before proceeding. Ideal for user confirmations and asynchronous notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Scheduled Jobs"
    icon="calendar"
  >
    Run jobs at regular intervals with support for cron expressions. Perfect for recurring tasks like reminders, reports, or newsletters.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Parallel Runs"
    icon="road"
  >
    Start independent tasks in parallel and wait for them to finish simultaneously, reducing latency.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Long Delays"
    icon="hourglass"
  >
    Need your code to “sleep” for days, weeks, or even months? Supports long delays beyond serverless time limits.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Delivery Guarantees"
    icon="rotate-right"
  >
    Ensures at-least-once delivery. Failed requests are logged in a Dead Letter Queue to prevent data loss.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Flow Control"
    icon="gauge"
    href="/workflow/howto/flow-control"
  >
    Prevent overwhelming your app or external services by configuring rate per second or parallelism limits. 
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Observability"
    icon="eye"
  >
    Monitor workflow steps with insights. Filter events to track successes, failures, retries, and stalls.
  </Card>

## How it works

Upstash Workflow builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

Each of the steps are executed by a separate request to your application, by preserving the output of previous steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, _each step_ can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.
