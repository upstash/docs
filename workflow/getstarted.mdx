## Overview

Upstash Workflow lets you write **durable, reliable and performant serverless functions**. Get delivery guarantees, automatic retries on failure, scheduling and more without managing any infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Failure Resilience**: If your platform experiences a temporary outage, your workflow can pick up right where it left off. Upstash Workflows ensures that your application will continue, even when your environment is unstable.
- **Long-Running Executions on Time-Limited Platforms**: Run long-running REST endpoints, such as complex AI models or video processing tools, even on serverless platforms with strict time limits.
- **Events with Wait/Notify Mechanism**: Create workflows that wait for external events before proceeding. Ideal for use cases like waiting for user input (e.g., clicking a confirmation email) or handling asynchronous notifications from external systems.
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Run jobs at regular intervals with support for cron expressions. Perfect for recurring tasks like reminders, regular reports, or newsletters. [Set up scheduled jobs here](/workflow/howto/schedule).
- **Parallel Runs**: Start independent tasks in parallel and wait for them to finish simultaneously, reducing latency. [Read more about parallel runs here](/workflow/howto/parallel-runs).
- **Long Delays**: Need your code to “sleep” for days, weeks, or even months? Upstash Workflows supports long delays beyond the time limits imposed by serverless platforms.
- **Delivery Guarantees**: Upstash Workflows guarantees at-least-once delivery. Once a request is accepted, it will run—even if the hosting platform experiences interruptions. In the rare case of failure, the request is logged in a Dead Letter Queue, so you never lose track of critical events.
- **Cost Reduction for Serverless Environments**: Serverless platforms charge based on execution time. With Upstash Workflows, you can offload time-consuming, I/O-bound tasks from serverless platforms, reducing operational costs. [See cost reduction example here](https://image-gen-with-workflow.vercel.app/).
- **Rate Limiting (Coming Soon)**: Prevent overwhelming external services by configuring rate limits for your workflows. Control the maximum number of operations per second, and ensure that burst traffic is managed without dropping any calls.
- **Observability**: Monitor your application's steps with comprehensive insights. Filter events to see which functions succeeded, failed, retried, or stalled. [Learn more about observability here](/workflow/howto/monitor).

## Quickstarts

Workflow supports Next.js, Cloudflare Workers and [many more frameworks](/workflow/quickstarts/platforms) in TypeScript and Python.

## How it works

Upstash Workflow builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, _each step_ can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.

## Code example

Let's see a practical implementation of Upstash Workflow using customer onboarding as an example. See our [Next.js Quickstart](/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs) or [FastAPI Quickstart](/workflow/quickstarts/fastapi) for a complete guide.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { sendEmail } from "./emailUtils";

// Type-safety for starting our workflow
interface InitialData {
  userId: string
  email: string
  name: string
}

export const { POST } = serve<InitialData>(async (context) => {
  const { userId, email, name } = context.requestPayload;

  // Step 1: Send welcome email
  await context.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(email, "Welcome to our service!");
  });

  // Step 2: Wait for 3 days (in seconds)
  await context.sleep("sleep-until-follow-up", 60 * 60 * 24 * 3);

  // Step 3: AI-generate personalized follow-up message
  const { body: aiResponse } = await context.api.openai.call(
    "generate-personalized-message",
    {
      token: "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
      operation: "chat.completions.create",
      body: {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are an assistant creating personalized follow-up messages." },
          { role: "user", content: `Create a short, friendly follow-up message for ${name} who joined our service 3 days ago.` }
        ]
      },
    }
  );

  const personalizedMessage = aiResponse.choices[0].message.content;

  // Step 4: Send personalized follow-up email
  await context.run("send-follow-up-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(email, personalizedMessage);
  });
});
```

```python main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from typing import Dict, TypedDict
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext, CallResponse
from email_utils import send_email

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


# Type-safety for starting our workflow
class InitialData(TypedDict):
    user_id: str
    email: str
    name: str


@serve.post("/api/onboarding")
async def onboarding_workflow(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[InitialData]) -> None:
    data = context.request_payload
    user_id = data["user_id"]
    email = data["email"]
    name = data["name"]

    # Step 1: Send welcome email
    async def _send_welcome_email() -> None:
        await send_email(email, "Welcome to our service!")

    await context.run("send-welcome-email", _send_welcome_email)

    # Step 2: Wait for 3 days (in seconds)
    await context.sleep("sleep-until-follow-up", 60 * 60 * 24 * 3)

    # Step 3: AI-generate personalized follow-up message
    ai_response: CallResponse[Dict[str, str]] = await context.call(
        "generate-personalized-message",
        url="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        method="POST",
        headers={...},
        body={
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are an assistant creating personalized follow-up messages.",
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Create a short, friendly follow-up message for {name} who joined our service 3 days ago.",
                },
            ],
        },
    )

    personalized_message = ai_response.body["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

    # Step 4: Send personalized follow-up email
    async def _send_follow_up_email() -> None:
        await send_email(email, personalized_message)

    await context.run("send-follow-up-email", _send_follow_up_email)

```

<Tip>
  Any HTTP request using `context.call`, like the AI-generation above, does not
  count towards your function's execution time and does not increase your
  serverless bill. It can also run for up to 2 hours, completely bypassing any
  platform-specific function timeouts.
</Tip>

Once your endpoint is ready, you can trigger the workflow via our SDKs or using plain REST.
See [here](/workflow/howto/start) for details. 
<CodeGroup>
```ts ts SDK(recommended)
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>",
  body: "hello there!",         // Optional body
  headers: { ... },             // Optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // Optional workflow run ID
  retries: 3                    // Optional retries for the initial request
});
```

```py python SDK
from qstash import AsyncQStash

client = AsyncQStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")

res = await client.message.publish_json(
    url="https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>",
    body={"hello": "there!"},
    headers={...},
    retries=3,
)
```

```bash REST
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE> -b '{"hello": "there!"}'
```
</CodeGroup>

The above example should give you a rough idea of how a workflow looks in code. For step-by-step instructions on setting up your first workflow with images along the way, see our [Next.js Quickstart](/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs) or [FastAPI Quickstart](/workflow/quickstarts/fastapi).
