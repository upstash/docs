title: "Secure an Endpoint"

To prevent _anyone_ from triggering your workflow endpoint, you can use two methods:

- QStash's [built-in request verification](/qstash/features/security)
- Custom header and custom authorization mechanism

### Using QStash's built-in request verification (recommended)

Use QStash's built-in request verification to allow only authorized clients to trigger your workflow. Set two environment variables in addition to your QStash API key:

```bash .env
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
```

And replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual keys. Find both of these keys in your QStash dashboard under the **"Signing keys"** tab:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/qstash_signing_keys.png" />
</Frame>

This will require **every request** to your workflow endpoint to include a valid signature, including the initial request that triggers a workflow. In other words: all requests need to come either from QStash (which automatically populates the `Upstash-Signature` header) or from a client that manually populates the `Upstash-Signature` header with your signing secret.

We suggest using QStash's publish API to trigger your workflow:

```bash Terminal
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_QSTASH_TOKEN>' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "initialData": "hello world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://<your-app-url>/api/workflow'
```

For edge cases that do not support environment variables as outlined above, you can explicitly pass your signing keys to the `serve` function:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(
  async (context) => {
    // Your workflow steps...
  },
  {
    receiver: new Receiver({
      currentSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY,
      nextSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY,
    }),
  }
);
```

```python Python
from qstash import Receiver

@serve.post(
    "/api/example",
    receiver=Receiver(
        current_signing_key=os.environ["QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY"],
        next_signing_key=os.environ["QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    ),
)
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    ...

```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom Authorization Method

You can use your own authorization mechanism with Upstash Workflow. We ensure that the initial headers and initial request body will be available on every call made to your workflow.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(
  async (context) => {
    const authHeader = context.headers.get("authorization");
    const bearerToken = authHeader?.split(" ")[1];

    if (!isValid(bearerToken)) {
      console.error("Authentication failed.");
      return;
    }

    // Your workflow steps..
  },
  {
    failureFunction: async () => {
      const authHeader = context.headers.get("authorization");
      const bearerToken = authHeader?.split(" ")[1];

      if (!isValid(bearerToken)) {
        // ...
      }
    },
  }
);
```

```python Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.post("/api/example")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    auth_header = context.headers.get("authorization")
    bearer_token = auth_header.split(" ")[1] if auth_header else None

    if not is_valid(bearer_token):
        print("Authentication failed.")
        return

    # Your workflow steps...

```
