title: "Start a Run"

You’ve defined your workflow, and the final step is to trigger the endpoint!

There are three main ways to start your workflow:

### 1. [Using `client.trigger` (Recommended)](/workflow/basics/client#trigger-workflow)

We recommend using `client.trigger` to start your workflow as it returns the workflow run ID in its result and results in one less QStash publish per workflow.

```ts
// Using the workflow client
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://workflow-endpoint.com",
  body: "hello there!",         // Optional body
  headers: { ... },             // Optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // Optional workflow run ID
  retries: 3                    // Optional retries for the initial request
});
```

### 2. [Publishing a message with QStash](/qstash/howto/publishing)

```ts
// Using the QStash client
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

const { messageId } = await client.publishJSON({
  url: "https://workflow-endpoint.com",
  body: { hello: "there!" },
  headers: { ... },    
  retries: 3           
});
```

### 3. Sending an HTTP Request

  <Tab title="curl">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://workflow-endpoint.com \
       -H "my-header: foo" \
       -b '{"foo": "bar"}'
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="fetch">
  ```js
  await fetch("https://workflow-endpoint.com", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ "foo": "bar" }),
    headers: {
      "my-header": "foo"
    }
  });
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Secured Endpoints

If you’ve [secured your endpoint with signing keys](/workflow/howto/security), only the first two methods (`trigger` and `publish`) will work. Direct calls to the endpoint (e.g., via `curl` or `fetch`) will not be accepted.

### Accessing Payload and Headers

When you call the endpoint, the payload and headers you send will be accessible in the context:  
- The payload is available in the `context.requestPayload` field.  
- The headers are available in the `context.headers` field.

For more details, refer to the documentation on [the Context object](/workflow/basics/context).
