You’ve defined your workflow, and the final step is to trigger the endpoint!

There are two main ways to start your workflow:

### Using `client.trigger` (Recommended)

We recommend using [`client.trigger`](/workflow/basics/client/trigger) to start your workflow.

<CodeGroup>
    ```ts Single Workflow
    import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
    const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
      url: "https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>",
      body: "hello there!",         // optional body
      headers: { ... },             // optional headers
      workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // optional workflow run id
      retries: 3                    // optional retries in the initial request
      delay: "10s"                  // optional delay value
      failureUrl: "https://<YOUR_FAILURE_URL>", // optional failure url
      flowControl: { ... }          // optional flow control
    })

    console.log(workflowRunId)
    // prints wfr_my-workflow
    ```

    ```ts Multiple Workflows
    import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
    const results = await client.trigger([
      {
        url: "<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>",
        // other options...
      },
      {
        url: "<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>",
        // other options...
      },
    ])

    console.log(results[0].workflowRunId)
    // prints wfr_my-workflow
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Sending an HTTP Request

This approach is recommended for quick testing via curl during development.

You should **NOT** start the workflow run in production by direct calls to your endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE> \
   -H "my-header: foo" \
   -d '{"foo": "bar"}'
```

<Warning>
    If you’ve secured your endpoint with signing keys, only the `trigger` method will work. Direct calls to the endpoint (e.g., via `curl` or `fetch`) will not be possible since `Upstash-Signature` header is missing.

    For more information, read [Secure a workflow](/workflow/howto/security) documentation.
