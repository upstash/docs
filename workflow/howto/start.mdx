You’ve defined your workflow, and the final step is to trigger the endpoint!

There are two main ways to start your workflow:

### 1. [Using `client.trigger` (Recommended)](/workflow/basics/client#trigger-workflow)

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

We recommend using `client.trigger` to start your workflow.

```ts
// Using the workflow client
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>",
  body: "hello there!",         // Optional body
  headers: { ... },             // Optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // Optional workflow run ID
  retries: 3                    // Optional retries for the initial request
});
```

### 2. Sending an HTTP Request

This approach is recommended for quick testing via curl. 

<Warning>
If you’ve [secured your endpoint with signing keys](/workflow/howto/security), only the `trigger` methid will work. Direct calls to the endpoint (e.g., via `curl` or `fetch`) will not be accepted.
</Warning>

  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE> \
       -H "my-header: foo" \
       -d '{"foo": "bar"}'
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="fetch (TypeScript)">
  ```js
  await fetch("https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ "foo": "bar" }),
    headers: {
      "my-header": "foo"
    }
  });
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="requests (Python)">
  ```python
  import requests

  requests.post(
      "https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>", json={"foo": "bar"}, headers={"my-header": "foo"}
  )

  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Accessing Payload and Headers

When you call the endpoint, the payload and headers you send will be accessible in the context:  
- The payload is available in the `context.requestPayload` field.  
- The headers are available in the `context.headers` field.

For more details, refer to the documentation on [the Context object](/workflow/basics/context).
