title: "Cancel a run"
---

You can cancel a running workflow both programatically and from your Upstash Workflow console. 

## Cancelling via console 

In your Upstash Workflow console, find the run you'd like to cancel and press the `Cancel Workflow` button on the right side:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/cancel_workflow.png" />
</Frame>

## Cancelling programatically

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
await client.cancel({ workflowRunId: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" })
```

And replace `<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>` with your actual run ID. You can also use the [Upstash Workflow REST API](/workflow/rest/runs/cancel) to cancel a run programatically.
