title: "Waiting for Events"

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in

  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.

You can use `context.waitForEvent` to pause a workflow until a specific event occurs and resume it with event data when the event is received.

<Tip>
  You can learn more about Workflow events from [our real-world
  example](/workflow/examples/waitForEvent).

## `context.waitForEvent`

The [`waitForEvent` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent) pauses the execution of a workflow and waits for an external event to occur, identified by an event ID. This is particularly useful in asynchronous workflows that rely on external systems to provide data or signals.

```typescript
const { eventData, timeout } = await context.waitForEvent(
  "description of event",
  "event-id",
  {
    timeout: timeoutInSeconds,
  }
);
```

Third parameter is the timeout. It is the maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the event. If the event doesn't occur within this time, the workflow will proceed, and the `timeout` variable will be `true`.

Maximum timeout value is equal to [the "Max Delay" value of your QStash plan](https://upstash.com/pricing/workflow). It's 7 days for free users, 1 year for pay as you go users and unlimited for pro users.

## `client.notify`

[The `notify` method](/workflow/basics/client#notify-waiting-workflow) is used to notify a workflow that the expected event has occurred. It notifies all workflows waiting for the given `eventId` and provides the `eventData` to the waiting workflows, allowing them to resume execution.

```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

await client.notify({
  eventId: "event-id",
  eventData: { my: "data" },
});
```

`eventData` provided in `client.notify` will be available in the result of `context.waitForEvent` as it is.

## `context.notify`

You can also notify workflows in another workflow using [the `context.notify` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-notify).

```typescript
const { notifyResponse } = await context.notify(
  "notify step", // notify step name
  "event-Id", // event id
  { my: "data" } // event data
);

```
