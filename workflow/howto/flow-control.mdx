title: "Limit Rate and Parallelism"
---

`Flow Control` enables you to limit the number of calls made to your workflow by delaying the delivery. 

There are two main use cases for Flow-Control in Workflow:  
1. [Limiting the Workflow Environment](#limiting-the-workflow-environment): Controlling the execution environment.  
2. [Limiting External API Calls](#limiting-external-api-calls): Preventing excessive requests to external services. 

---

There are three parameters you can configure to achieve the desired behavior:

- **Rate and Period**:  
  - **Rate** specifies the maximum number of calls allowed within a given period (default: 1 second, configurable via the `period` parameter). All calls sharing the same `FlowControl` key count toward this limit. Instead of rejecting calls that exceed the rate, QStash automatically queues and delays them to ensure the limit is respected.
  - **Period** is the time window over which the rate limit is enforced. Adjust this to control how frequently calls are allowed.

- **Parallelism**:  
  Sets the maximum number of calls that can be executed concurrently. Unlike rate limiting, this parameter considers the duration of each call. If the parallelism limit is reached, additional calls are queued and will only start when an active call completes, ensuring that the number of simultaneous executions never exceeds the specified limit.

**Using Rate and Parallelism Together**: All parameters can be combined. For example, with a rate of 10 per second and parallelism of 20, if each request takes a minute to complete, QStash will trigger 10 calls in the first second and another 10 in the next. Since none of them will have finished, the system will wait until one completes before triggering another.  

For the `FlowControl`, you need to choose a key first. This key is used to count the number of calls made to your endpoint.
There are not limits to number of keys you can use.

<Warning>
The rate/parallelism limits are not applied per `url`, they are applied per `Flow-Control-Key`. 
</Warning>

<Warning>
Keep in mind that rate/period and parallelism info are kept on each publish separately. That means 
if you change the rate/period or parallelism on a new publish, the old fired ones will not be affected. They will keep their flowControl config. 
During the period that old `publishes` has not delivered but there are also the `publishes` with the new rates, QStash will effectively allow 
the highest rate/period or highest parallelism. Eventually(after the old publishes are delivered), the new rate/period and parallelism will be used.
</Warning>

#### Limiting the Workflow Environment  

To limit the execution environment, you need to configure both the `serve` and `trigger` methods. 
When configured, all the steps of the workflow will respect the limits.
Due to the nature of the Workflow SDK, QStash calls the `serve` method multiple times. This means that to stay within the limits 
of the deployed environments, the given rate will be applied to all calls going from QStash servers to the `serve` method.

Note that if there are multiple Workflows running in the same environment, their steps can interleave, but overall rate and parallelism limits will be respected 
if they share the same `flowControl` key.

- **In the `serve` method**:  

```js
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    await context.run("step-1", async () => {
      return someWork();
    });
  },
  {
    flowControl: { key: "app1", parallelism: 3, rate: 10, period: "1m" }
  }
);
```

For more details, see the [`flowControl` documentation under `serve` parameters](/workflow/basics/serve#flowcontrol).

- **In the `trigger` method**:  

```js
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QStash_TOKEN>" });
const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://workflow-endpoint.com",
  body: "hello there!",
  flowControl: { key: "app1", parallelism: 3, rate: 10 }
});
```

For more details on `trigger`, see the documentation [here](/workflow/basics/client#trigger-workflow).  

#### Limiting External API Calls  

To limit requests to an external API, use `context.call`:  

```js 
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<{ topic: string }>(async (context) => {
  const request = context.requestPayload;

  const response = await context.call(
    "generate-long-essay", 
    {
      url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      method: "POST",
      body: {/*****/},
      flowControl: { key: "opani-call", parallelism: 3, rate: 10 }
    }
  );
});
```

For more details, see the documentation [here](/workflow/basics/context#context-call).  

#### Rest API for Flow Control Information

You can also use the Rest API to get information on the flow control.
See the [API documentation](/workflow/rest/flow-control/get) for more details.
