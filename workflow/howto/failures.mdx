title: "Handle failed runs"
---

This guide shows you how to **gracefully handle failed workflow runs**. This involves best practices on resolving runtime errors, logging and manually retrying runs that have failed multiple times.

## Why a workflow might fail

- A step in your workflow throws a database error that causes your code to fail at runtime.
- QStash calls your workflow URL, but the URL is not reachable - for example, because of a temporary outage of your deployment platform.
- A single step takes longer than your platform's function execution limit.

QStash automatically retries a failed step **three times with exponential backoff** to allow temporary outages to resolve.

If, even after all retries, your step does not succeed, we'll move the failed run into your [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](/qstash/howto/handling-failures#dead-letter-queue). That way, you can always manually retry it again and debug the issue.

If you want to take an action (a cleanup/log), you can configure either `failureFunction` or a `failureUrl` on the `serve` method of your workflow.
These options allow you to define custom logic or an external endpoint that will be triggered when a failure occurs.

## Using a `failureFunction` (recommended)

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

The `serve` function you use to create a workflow endpoint accepts a `failureFunction` parameter - an easy way to gracefully handle errors (i.e. logging them to Sentry) or your custom handling logic.

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    // Your workflow logic...
  },
  {
    failureFunction: async ({
      context,
      failStatus,
      failResponse,
      failHeaders,
    }) => {
      // Handle error, i.e. log to Sentry
    },
  }
);
```

Note: If you use a custom authorization method to secure your workflow endpoint, add authorization to the `failureFunction` too. Otherwise, anyone could invoke your failure function. Read more here: [securing your workflow endpoint](/workflow/howto/security).

## Using a `failureUrl`

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

The `failureUrl` handles cases where the service hosting your workflow URL is unavailable. In this case, a workflow failure notification is sent to another reachable endpoint.

```typescript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    // Your workflow logic...
  },
  {
    failureUrl: "https://<YOUR_FAILURE_URL>/workflow-failure",
  }
);
```

## Debugging failed runs

In your DLQ, filter messages via the `Workflow URL` or `Workflow Run ID` to search for a particular failure. We include all request and response headers and bodies to simplify debugging failed runs.

For example, let's debug the following failed run. Judging by the status code `404`, the `Ngrok-Error-Code` header of `ERR_NGROK_3200` and the returned HTML body, we know that the URL our workflow called does not exist.
