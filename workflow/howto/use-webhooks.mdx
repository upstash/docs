## Overview

Webhooks allow external services to notify your application when events occur. For example, you can use webhooks to receive notifications when a new order is placed in your e-commerce store, a new user signs up, or a new message is sent in your chat application.

Upstash Workflow provides a simple way to receive these events and trigger workflows based on the incoming data autonomously.

### Setting Up Webhook Endpoints

#### Basic Setup

To create a webhook endpoint, use the `serve` function from `@upstash/workflow`:

```typescript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(
  async (context) => {
    // Your webhook handling logic here
  },
  {
    initialPayloadParser: (payload) => {
      return payload;
    },
  }
);
```

#### Request Validation

Always validate incoming webhook requests to ensure they're legitimate. This way, no one other than the original webhook source can trigger your workflow. Here's an example using Clerk webhooks with Svix:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Validate and Parse in Workflow
export const { POST } = serve<string>(async (context) => {
	const payloadString = context.requestPayload;
	const headerPayload = context.headers;

    let event: WebhookEvent;
    try {
    	event = await validateRequest(payloadString, headerPayload);
    } catch {
    	return
    }

    // Next steps based on the event

})

````

```typescript Validation Function
import { Webhook } from "svix";
import { WebhookEvent } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

const webhookSecret = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET";

async function validateRequest(payloadString: string, headerPayload: Headers) {
  const svixHeaders = {
    "svix-id": headerPayload.get("svix-id") as string,
    "svix-timestamp": headerPayload.get("svix-timestamp") as string,
    "svix-signature": headerPayload.get("svix-signature") as string,
  };
  const wh = new Webhook(webhookSecret);
  return wh.verify(payloadString, svixHeaders) as WebhookEvent;
}
````

</CodeGroup>

### Handling Webhook events

Use the context.run method to process webhook events in discrete, trackable steps:

```typescript
export const { POST } = serve(async (context) => {
  // ... Parse and validate the incoming request

  const user = await context.run<false | UserPayload>(
    "handle-webhook-event",
    async () => {
      if (event.type === "user.created") {
        const { id: clerkUserId, email_addresses, first_name } = event.data;
        const primaryEmail = email_addresses.find(
          (email) => (email.id = event.data.primary_email_address_id)
        );

        if (!primaryEmail) {
          return false;
        }

        return {
          event: event.type,
          userId: clerkUserId,
          email: primaryEmail.email_address,
          firstName: first_name,
        } as UserPayload;
      }
      return false;
    }
  );
});
```

After validating the webhook and extracting the initial user data, you'll often need to perform additional operations like creating customer records, sending welcome emails etc.

```typescript
export const { POST } = serve(async (context) => {
  // ... Previous validation and user data extraction

  if (!user) {
    return;
  }

  const customer = await context.run("create-stripe-customer", async () => {
    return await stripe.customers.create({
      email: user.email,
      name: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`,
      metadata: {
        userId: user.userId,
      },
    });
  });

  /// ... Additional steps
});
```

You're now ready to perform any operation in the following steps.
