title: "Development Server"
---

Upstash Workflow is built on top of Upstash QStash.
The QStash CLI provides a local development server that performs QStash functionality locally for development and testing purposes.


<Steps>
    <Step title="Install and Start Development Server">
        Start the development server using the QStash CLI:

        ```javascript
        npx @upstash/qstash-cli dev
        ```

        The QStash CLI output will look something like this:

        ```plaintext QStash CLI Output
        Upstash QStash development server is runnning at

        ```

        For detailed instructions on setting up the development server, see our [QStash Local Development Guide](/qstash/howto/local-development).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable Local Mode on Console">
        Once you start the local server, you can go to the Workflow tab on Upstash Console and enable local mode, which will allow you to monitor and debug workflow runs with the local server.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Update Environment Variables">
        Once your development server is running, update your environment variables to route QStash requests to your local server.

        ```env
        QSTASH_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
        QSTASH_TOKEN="eyJVc2VySUQiOiJkZWZhdWx0VXNlciIsIlBhc3N3b3JkIjoiZGVmYXVsdFBhc3N3b3JkIn0="
        QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_7RvLjqfZBvP5KEUimQCE1pvpLuou"
        QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_7W3ZNbfKWk5NWwEs3U4ixuQ7fxwE"
        ```

    </Step>

    <Step title="Use local addresses">
        It's all set up ðŸŽ‰

        Now, you can use your local address when triggering the workflow runs.


        ```javascript
        import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

        const client = Client()

        const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
            url: `http://localhost:3000/api/workflow`,
            retries: 3,
            keepTriggerConfig: true,
        });
        ```
        <Tip>
        Inside the `trigger()` call, you need to provide the URL of your workflow endpoint:

        - Local development â†’ use the URL where your app is running, for example: http://localhost:3000/api/PATH
        - Production â†’ use the URL of your deployed app, for example: https://yourapp.com/api/PATH

        To avoid hardcoding URLs, you can define a `BASE_URL` constant and set it based on the environment.
        A common pattern is to check an environment variable that only exists in production:

        ```javascript
        const BASE_URL = process.env.VERCEL_URL
          ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
          : `http://localhost:3000`

        const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
            url: `${BASE_URL}/api/workflow`,
            retries: 3,
            keepTriggerConfig: true,
        });
        ```
        </Tip>

    </Step>
