This workflow involves chaining multiple LLM calls, where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next agent.

```ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { WikipediaQueryRun } from "@langchain/community/tools/wikipedia_query_run";

export const { POST } = serve(async (context) => {
  const model = context.agents.openai('gpt-3.5-turbo');

  const agent1 = context.agents.agent({
    model,
    name: 'firstAgent',
    maxSteps: 1,
    background: 'You are an agent that lists famous physicists.',
    tools: {}
  });

  const agent2 = context.agents.agent({
    model,
    name: 'secondAgent',
    // set to 2 as this agent will first request tools
    // and then summarize them:
    maxSteps: 2,
    background:
      'You are an agent that describes the work of' +
      ' the physicists listed in the previous prompt.',
    tools: {
      wikiTool: new WikipediaQueryRun({
        topKResults: 1,
        maxDocContentLength: 500,
      })
    }
  });

  const agent3 = context.agents.agent({
    model,
    name: 'thirdAgent',
    maxSteps: 1,
    background:
      'You are an agent that summarizes the ' +
      'works of the physicists mentioned previously.',
    tools: {}
  });

  // Chaining agents
  const firstOutput = await context.agents.task({
    agent: agent1,
    prompt: "List 3 famous physicists."
  }).run();

  const secondOutput = await context.agents.task({
    agent: agent2,
    prompt: `Describe the work of: ${firstOutput.text}`
  }).run();
  

  const { text } = await context.agents.task({
    agent: agent3,
    prompt: `Summarize: ${secondOutput.text}`
  }).run();

  console.log(text);
});
```

In response to the prompt, our agents generate this response:

```
Albert Einstein was a German physicist known for his theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc^2. He made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. 

Isaac Newton, an English polymath, was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. He is famous for his laws of motion and universal gravitation, as outlined in his book "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica."

Marie Curie, a Polish-French physicist and chemist, conducted pioneering research on radioactivity and was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She is the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two scientific fields and her work has had a lasting impact on physics and chemistry.
