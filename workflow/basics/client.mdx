<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.

Workflow client allows you to interact with your workflow runs. Currently, it has three basic functionality:

- [cancel a running workflow run](/workflow/howto/cancel)
- notify a workflow run [waiting for an event](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent)
- get workflow runs waiting for some event

We are planning to add more functionality in the future. See [the roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for more details.

## Trigger Workflow

Using the `trigger` method, you can start a workflow run and get its run id.

```ts
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>",
  body: "hello there!",         // optional body
  headers: { ... },             // optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // optional workflow run id
  retries: 3                    // optional retries in the initial request
})

console.log(workflowRunId)
// prints wfr_my-workflow
```

If `workflowRunId` parameter isn't passed, a run id will be generated randomly. If `workflowRunId` is passed, `wfr_` prefix will be added to it.

For other alternatives of starting a workflow, see the [documentation on starting a workflow run](/workflow/howto/start).

## Cancel Workflow Runs

There are multiple ways you can cancel workflow runs:

- pass one or more workflow run ids to cancel them
- pass a workflow url to cancel all runs starting with this url
- cancel all pending or active workflow runs

### Cancel a set of workflow runs

```ts
// cancel a single workflow
await client.cancel({ ids: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" });

// cancel a set of workflow runs
await client.cancel({ ids: ["<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_1>", "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_2>"] });
```

### Cancel workflows starting with a url

If you have an endpoint called `https://your-endpoint.com` and you
want to cancel all workflow runs on it, you can use `urlStartingWith`.

Note that this will cancel workflows in all endpoints under
`https://your-endpoint.com`.

```ts
await client.cancel({ urlStartingWith: "https://your-endpoint.com" });
```

### Cancel _all_ workflows

To cancel all pending and currently running workflows, you can
do it like this:

```ts
await client.cancel({ all: true });
```

## Notify Waiting Workflow

To notify a workflow waiting for an event, you can use the `notify` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
await client.notify({
  eventId: "my-event-id",
  eventData: "my-data", // data passed to the workflow run
});
```

The data passed in `eventData` will be available to the workflow run in the
[`eventData` field of the `context.waitForEvent` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent).

## Get Waiters of Event

To get the list of waiters for some event id, you can use the `getWaiters` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const result = await client.getWaiters({
  eventId: "my-event-id",
});
```

Result will be a list of `Waiter` objects:
