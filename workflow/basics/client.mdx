<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

Workflow client allows you to interact with your workflow runs. Currently, it has three basic functionality:

- [cancel a running workflow run](/workflow/howto/cancel)
- notify a workflow run [waiting for an event](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent)
- get workflow runs waiting for some event

We are planning to add more functionality in the future. See [the roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for more details.

## Trigger Workflow

Using the `trigger` method, you can start a workflow run and get its run id.

<CodeGroup>
```ts Single Workflow
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>/<YOUR-WORKFLOW-ROUTE>",
  body: "hello there!",         // optional body
  headers: { ... },             // optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // optional workflow run id
  retries: 3,                   // optional retries in the initial request
  retryDelay: "1000 * (1 + retried)", // optional delay between retries
  delay: "10s"                  // optional delay value
  failureUrl: "https://<YOUR_FAILURE_URL>", // optional failure url
  useFailureFunction: true,     // whether a failure function is defined in the endpoint
  flowControl: {                // optional flow control
    key: "USER_GIVEN_KEY",
    rate: 10,
    parallelism: 5,
    period: "10m"
  },
})

console.log(workflowRunId)
// prints wfr_my-workflow
```

```ts Multiple Workflows
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const results = await client.trigger([
  {
    url: "<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>",
    // other options...
  },
  {
    url: "<YOUR_WORKFLOW_ENDPOINT>",
    // other options...
  },
])

console.log(results[0].workflowRunId)
// prints wfr_my-workflow
```
</CodeGroup>

If both `failureUrl` and `useFailureFunction` are provided, `useFailureFunction` takes precedence and the value of the `url` parameter is used as `failureUrl`.

If `workflowRunId` parameter isn't passed, a run id will be generated randomly. If `workflowRunId` is passed, `wfr_` prefix will be added to it.

For other alternatives of starting a workflow, see the [documentation on starting a workflow run](/workflow/howto/start).

## Get Workflow Logs

Using the `log` method, you can use the [List Workflow Runs API](/workflow/rest/runs/logs):

```ts
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
const { runs, cursor } = await client.logs({
  // Id of the workflow run to get
  workflowRunId,
  // Number of workflows to get
  count,
  // Workflow state to filter for.
  // One of "RUN_STARTED", "RUN_SUCCESS", "RUN_FAILED", "RUN_CANCELED"
  state,
  // Workflow url to search for. should be an exact match
  workflowUrl,       
  // Unix timestamp when the run was created
  workflowCreatedAt, 
  // Cursor from a previous request to continue the search
  cursor             
})
```

All the parameters above are optional.

The response includes `cursor` and `runs`. Using the `cursor`, you can continue the search later.

`runs` will be a list of runs. Each run has these fields:

- `workflowRunId`: ID of the workflow
- `workflowUrl`: URL of the workflow
- `workflowState`: State of the workflow run.
- `workflowRunCreatedAt`: number; Time when the workflow run started (as unix timestamp)
- `workflowRunCompletedAt`; If run has completed, time when workflow run completed (as unix timestamp)
- `failureFunction`: Information on the message published when the workflow failed and [`failureUrl`](/workflow/basics/serve#failureurl) or [`failureFunction`](/workflow/basics/serve#failurefunction) were called
- `dlqId`: If the workflow run has failed, DLQ id associated with the workflow run.
- `workflowRunResponse`: Result returned at the end of the workflow.
- `invoker`: If the [workflow was invoked](/workflow/howto/invoke); run id, url and created time of the invoking workflow.
- `steps`: List of steps showing the progress of the workflow.

The `steps` field contains a list of steps. Each step is in one of the following three formats:

<CodeGroup>
```ts Single Step
{
  type: "single";
  // a single step in an array
  steps: [
    {
      // step info...
    }
  ]
}
```

```ts Parallel Steps
{
  type: "parallel";
  // an array of steps
  steps: [ ... ]
}
```

```ts Next Step
{
  type: "next";
  // and array of steps with messageId and state
  steps: [
    {
      messageId: string;
      state: "STEP_PROGRESS" | "STEP_RETRY" | "STEP_FAILED"
    }
  ];
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Cancel Workflow Runs

There are multiple ways you can cancel workflow runs:

- pass one or more workflow run ids to cancel them
- pass a workflow url to cancel all runs starting with this url
- cancel all pending or active workflow runs

### Cancel a set of workflow runs

```ts
// cancel a single workflow
await client.cancel({ ids: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" });

// cancel a set of workflow runs
await client.cancel({ ids: ["<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_1>", "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_2>"] });
```

### Cancel workflows starting with a url

If you have an endpoint called `https://your-endpoint.com` and you
want to cancel all workflow runs on it, you can use `urlStartingWith`.

Note that this will cancel workflows in all endpoints under
`https://your-endpoint.com`.

```ts
await client.cancel({ urlStartingWith: "https://your-endpoint.com" });
```

### Cancel _all_ workflows

To cancel all pending and currently running workflows, you can
do it like this:

```ts
await client.cancel({ all: true });
```

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

The DLQ functionality allows you to manage failed workflow runs that have been moved to the dead letter queue.

### List DLQ Messages

```ts
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

// Define filters for the DLQ messages (optional)
const dlqFilters = {
  fromDate: Date.now() - 86400000, // last 24 hours
  toDate: Date.now(),
  url: "https://your-endpoint.com",
  responseStatus: 500
}

// List all DLQ messages
const { messages, cursor } = await client.dlq.list({ filter: dlqFilters });

// List with pagination and filtering
const result = await client.dlq.list({
  cursor,
  count: 10,
  filter: dlqFilters
});

```

### Resume Failed Workflows

Resume a workflow from where it failed:

<CodeGroup>
```ts Single
const { messages } = await client.dlq.list();

const response = await client.dlq.resume({
  dlqId: messages[0].dlqId, // Use the dlqId from the message
  flowControl: {
    key: "my-flow-control-key",
    value: "my-flow-control-value",
  },
  retries: 3,
});

```
```ts Multiple
const responses = await client.dlq.resume({
  dlqId: ["dlq-12345", "dlq-67890"],
  retries: 5,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Restart Failed Workflows

Restart a workflow from the beginning:

<CodeGroup>
```ts Single
const { messages } = await client.dlq.list();

const response = await client.dlq.restart({
  dlqId: messages[0].dlqId, // Use the dlqId from the message
  flowControl: {
    key: "my-flow-control-key",
    value: "my-flow-control-value",
  },
  retries: 3,
});

```
```ts Multiple
const responses = await client.dlq.restart({
  dlqId: ["dlq-12345", "dlq-67890"],
  retries: 5,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The difference between `resume` and `restart`:
- **Resume**: Continues execution from where the workflow failed
- **Restart**: Starts execution from the beginning with the same initial payload

### Retry Failure Function

If a workflow's `failureFunction` or `failureUrl` request has failed, you can retry it using the `retryFailureFunction` method:

```ts
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

// Retry the failure callback for a specific DLQ message
const response = await client.dlq.retryFailureFunction({
  dlqId: "dlq-12345" // The ID of the DLQ message to retry
});
```

This method allows you to retry the failure callback of a workflow run whose `failureUrl` or `failureFunction` request has failed.

## Notify Waiting Workflow

To notify a workflow waiting for an event, you can use the `notify` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
await client.notify({
  eventId: "my-event-id",
  eventData: "my-data", // data passed to the workflow run
});
```

The data passed in `eventData` will be available to the workflow run in the
[`eventData` field of the `context.waitForEvent` method](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent).

## Get Waiters of Event

To get the list of waiters for some event id, you can use the `getWaiters` method:

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const result = await client.getWaiters({
  eventId: "my-event-id",
});
```

Result will be a list of `Waiter` objects:
