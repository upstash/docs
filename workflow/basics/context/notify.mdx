`context.notify()` notifies workflows that are waiting for a specific event, passing along an optional payload.

It is typically used in combination with [`context.waitForEvent`](/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent).

## Arguments

<ParamField body="stepName" type="string">
    A unique identifier for the step.

<ParamField body="eventId" type="string">
    The identifier of the event to notify.
    Must match the `eventId` used in `context.waitForEvent`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="eventData" type="any">
    Data to deliver to the waiting workflow(s).
    This value will be returned in `eventData` from the corresponding `waitForEvent` call.
</ParamField>

## Response

`context.notify()` returns a list of waiters describing the workflows that were notified.

<ResponseField name="notifyResponse" type="NotifyResponse[]">
    A list of `NotifyResponse` objects describing each workflow that was waiting on the event.

    <Expandable defaultOpen>
        <ResponseField name="messageId" type="string">
