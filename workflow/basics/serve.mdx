title: "Create a workflow"
---

Use the `serve` method to define an endpoint that serves a workflow. It provides a context object that you use to create all of your workflow's steps.

For example, in a Next.js or FastAPI app:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(async (context) => {
  const result = await context.run("step-1", async () => {
    // define a piece of business logic as step 1
  });

  await context.run("step-2", async () => {
    // define another piece of business logic as step 2
  });
});
```

```python Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.post("/api/example")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    async def _step1() -> str:
        # define a piece of business logic as step 1
        return "step 1 result"

    result = await context.run("step-1", _step1)

    async def _step2() -> None:
        # define another piece of business logic as step 2
        pass

    await context.run("step-2", _step2)

```

</CodeGroup>

## Platform support

Besides Next.js and FastAPI, the `serve` method supports multiple frameworks and platforms. See [all supported platforms](/workflow/quickstarts/platforms) here.

## Options

### `failureUrl`

Use the `failureUrl` option to specify a URL your workflow will call if it exhausted all retries and fails.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    failureUrl: "https://<YOUR-FAILURE-ENDPOINT>/..."
  }
);
```

```python Python
@serve.post("/api/example", failureUrl="https://<YOUR-FAILURE-ENDPOINT>/...")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...
```

</CodeGroup>

If specified, this URL will be called with [the failure callback payload](qstash/features/callbacks#what-is-a-failure-callback), and the error message will be included in the `body` field.

The default value is `undefined`, meaning no failure URL is called.

### `failureFunction`

Use the `failureFunction` to define a function that's executed when your workflow exhausts all its [retries](/qstash/features/retry) and fails.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    failureFunction: async ({
      context,      // context during failure
      failStatus,   // failure status
      failResponse, // failure message
      failHeaders   // failure headers
    }) => {
      // handle the failure
    }
  }
);
```

```python Python
async def failure_function(
    context,       # context during failure
    fail_status,   # failure status
    fail_response, # failure message
    fail_headers   # failure headers
):
    # handle the failure
    pass

@serve.post("/api/example", failure_function=failure_function)
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...
```

</CodeGroup>


If both `failureUrl` and `failureFunction` are provided, the failure function takes precedence and the value of `failureUrl` is ignored.

By default, `failureFunction` is `undefined`, meaning that no function is executed on failure.

### `retries`

To specify the number of times QStash will call the workflow endpoint in case of errors, you can use the `verbose` parameter.

The default value is 3.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    retries: 3
  }
);
```

```python Python
@serve.post("/api/example", retries=3)
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...
```

</CodeGroup>

### `flowControl`

To control the rate of requests to your endpoint, use the `rate` and `period` options. To limit the maximum number of concurrent requests, use the `parallelism` option within the `flowControl` settings. See the [flow control section](/workflow/howto/flow-control) for more details.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    flowControl: { key: "aFlowControlKey",  rate: 10, parallelism: 3 }
  }
);
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also pass only `rate` or `parallelism` if you only need one of the two.

By default, there is no rate per second or parallelism limit.


### `verbose`

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

To gain insights into how the workflow operates, you can enable verbose mode:

```typescript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    verbose: true
  }
);
```

Each log entry has the following structure:

```
{
  timestamp: number,
  workflowRunId: string,
  logLevel: string,
  eventType: string,
  details: unknown,
}
```

The `eventType` can be:

- `ENDPOINT_START` each time the workflow endpoint is called
- `RUN_SINGLE` or `RUN_PARALLEL` when step(s) are executed
- `SUBMIT_STEP` when a single step is executed
- `SUBMIT_FIRST_INVOCATION` when a new workflow run starts
- `SUBMIT_CLEANUP` when a workflow run finishes
- `SUBMIT_THIRD_PARTY_RESULT` when a third-party call result is received (see `context.call`)

Verbose mode is disabled by default.

### `initialPayloadParser`

When calling the workflow endpoint to start a workflow run, your initial request's payload is expected to be either empty, a string, or JSON.

If your payload differs, you can process it as needed using the `initialPayloadParser` option:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
type InitialPayload = {
  foo: string;
  bar: number;
};

// ðŸ‘‡ 1: provide initial payload type
export const { POST } = serve<InitialPayload>(
  async (context) => {
    // ðŸ‘‡ 3: parsing result is available as requestPayload
    const payload: InitialPayload = context.requestPayload;
  },
  {
    // ðŸ‘‡ 2: custom parsing for initial payload
    initialPayloadParser: (initialPayload) => {
      const payload: InitialPayload = parsePayload(initialPayload);
      return payload;
    },
  }
);
```

```python Python
@dataclass
class InitialPayload:
    foo: str
    bar: int


def initial_payload_parser(initial_payload: str) -> InitialPayload:
    return parse_payload(initial_payload)


@serve.post("/api/example", initial_payload_parser=initial_payload_parser)
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[InitialPayload]) -> None:
    payload: InitialPayload = context.request_payload

```

</CodeGroup>

### `url`

Since a workflow run involves multiple calls to the workflow endpoint, the `serve` method needs to know where your endpoint is hosted.

Typically, your workflow infers this using the `request.url` field.

However, if you use a proxy or a local tunnel for development, you may want to override the URL inferred from `request.url`:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    url: "https://<YOUR-DEPLOYED-APP>.com/api/workflow"
  }
);
```

```python Python
@serve.post("/api/example", url="https://<YOUR-DEPLOYED-APP>.com/api/workflow")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...
```

</CodeGroup>

By default, `url` is `undefined`, and the URL is inferred from `request.url`.

### `baseUrl`

An alternative to the `url` option is the `baseUrl` option. While `url` replaces the entire URL inferred from `request.url`, `baseUrl` only changes the base of the URL:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    ...
  },
  // options:
  {
    baseUrl: "<LOCAL-TUNNEL-PUBLIC-URL>"
  }
);
```

```python Python
@serve.post("/api/example", base_url="<LOCAL-TUNNEL-PUBLIC-URL>")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...

```

</CodeGroup>

The default value of `baseUrl` is `undefined`.

If you have multiple endpoints and you don't want to set `baseUrl` in every single one, you can set the `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` environment variable to apply `baseUrl` across your entire application.

Setting this environment variable is especially useful during [local development](/workflow/howto/local-development). In production, `baseUrl` or `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` are not necessary.

## Further options

The following options can be considered convenience methods. They are intended to support edge cases or testing pipelines and are **not required for regular use**.

### `qstashClient`

The `qstashClient` option allows you to pass a QStash Client explicitly. This can be helpful when using multiple QStash clients in the same project with different environment variables.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    qstashClient: new Client({ token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN })
  }
);
```

```python Python
from qstash import AsyncQStash


@serve.post("/api/example", qstash_client=AsyncQStash(os.environ["QSTASH_TOKEN"]))
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...

```

</CodeGroup>

By default, a `qstashClient` is initialized as:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
new Client({
  baseUrl: process.env.QSTASH_URL!,
  token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN!,
});
```

```python Python
AsyncQStash(os.environ["QSTASH_TOKEN"])
```

</CodeGroup>

### `receiver`

You can pass a QStash Receiver to verify that **every** request the endpoint receives comes from QStash, preventing anyone from triggering your workflow.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    receiver: new Receiver({
      // ðŸ‘‡ grab these variables from your QStash dashboard
      currentSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY!,
      nextSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY!,
    })
  }
);
```

```python Python
from qstash import Receiver

@serve.post(
    "/api/example",
    receiver=Receiver(
        current_signing_key=os.environ["QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY"],
        next_signing_key=os.environ["QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    ),
)
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    ...
```

</CodeGroup>

The default receiver is automatically used if the environment variables `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` are set. If you want to turn off the Receiver, remove these environment variables or pass `receiver: undefined` in the options. Note that this will skip any verification that requests are coming from QStash and allow anyone to start your workflow.

### `env`

By default, the SDK uses `process.env` to initialize the QStash client and the receiver (if the two environment variables are set). If `process.env` doesn't exist, the SDK won't be able to access the environment variables. In this case, you can either pass `qstashClient` and `receiver` options or use the `env` option.

If you pass `env`, this `env` will be used instead of `process.env`:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    // the env option will be available in the env field of the context:
    const env = context.env;
  },
  {
    receiver: new Receiver({
      // ðŸ‘‡ grab these variables from your QStash dashboard
      currentSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY!,
      nextSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY!,
    }),
  }
);
```

```python Python
@serve.post(
    "/api/example",
    env={
        "QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY": os.environ["QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY"],
        "QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY": os.environ["QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    },
)
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    ...
```

</CodeGroup>

### `disableTelemetry`

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

By default, Workflow SDK sends telemetry about SDK version, framework or runtime.

You can set `disableTelemetry` to `false` if you wish to disable this behavior.

```typescript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    disableTelemetry: true
  }
);
```
