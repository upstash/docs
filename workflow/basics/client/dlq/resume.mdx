title: "client.dlq.resume"
---

The `dlq.resume` method resumes one or more workflow runs from the **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** at the point where they previously failed.
This allows you to continue execution from the failed step instead of restarting the workflow from the beginning.

## Arguments

<ParamField body="dlqId" type="string|string[]" required>
    The DLQ entry ID or list of IDs to resume.
    Use the `dlqId` field from messages returned by `client.dlq.list()`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="flowControl" type="object" optional>
    An optional flow control configuration to limit concurrency and execution rate
    of resumed workflow runs.

    See [Flow Control](/workflow/howto/flow-control) for details.

    <Expandable title="properties">
        <ParamField body="key" type="string">
            A logical grouping key that identifies which resumed runs share the same flow control limits.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="rate" type="number">
            The maximum number of allowed resumption requests per second.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="parallelism" type="number">
            The maximum number of resumed runs that can execute concurrently.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="period" type="string|number">
            The time window used to enforce the defined rate limit.
        </ParamField>
    </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="retries" type="number" optional>
    Number of retry attempts to apply when resuming the workflow run.
    Defaults to `3` if not provided.
</ParamField>

## Response

`client.dlq.resume()` returns one or more objects with details of the resumed workflow run(s):

<ResponseField name="workflowRuns" type="object[]">
    <Expandable defaultOpen>
        <ResponseField name="workflowRunId" type="string">
            The ID of the workflow run resumed from the DLQ message.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="workflowCreatedAt" type="number">
            The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the resumed run was created.
        </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

  flowControl: {
    key: "my-flow-control-key",
    value: "my-flow-control-value",
  },
  retries: 3,
});

```
```ts Multiple
const responses = await client.dlq.resume({
