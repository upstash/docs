title: "client.dlq.restart"
---

The `dlq.restart` method restarts one or more workflow runs from **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.
This allows you to reprocess workflow runs that previously failed after exhausting retries.

## Arguments

<ParamField body="dlqId" type="string|string[]" required>
    The DLQ entry ID or list of IDs to restart.
    Use the `dlqId` field from messages returned by `client.dlq.list()`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="flowControl" type="object" optional>
    An optional flow control configuration to limit concurrency and execution rate of restarted workflow runs.

    See [Flow Control](/workflow/features/flow-control) for details.

    <Expandable title="properties">
        <ParamField body="key" type="string">
          A logical grouping key that identifies which requests share the same flow control limits.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="rate" type="number">
            The maximum number of allowed requests per second.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="parallelism" type="number">
            The maximum number of concurrent requests allowed.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="period" type="string|number">
            The time window used to enforce the defined rate limit. Default is `1s`.
        </ParamField>
    </Expandable>

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="retries" type="number" optional>
    Number of retry attempts to apply to the restarted workflow invocation.
    Defaults to `3` if not provided.
</ParamField>

## Response

`client.dlq.restart()` returns one or more objects containing details of the restarted workflow run(s):

<ResponseField name="workflowRuns" type="object[]">
    <Expandable defaultOpen>
        <ResponseField name="workflowRunId" type="string">
            The ID of the new workflow run created from the restarted DLQ message.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="workflowCreatedAt" type="number">
            The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the new workflow run was created.
        </ResponseField>

    </Expandable>

</ResponseField>

## Usage

<CodeGroup>
```ts Single
const { messages } = await client.dlq.list();

const response = await client.dlq.restart({
  dlqId: messages[0].dlqId, // Use the dlqId from the message
  flowControl: {
    key: "my-flow-control-key",
    parallelism: 10,
  },
  retries: 3,
});

```
```ts Multiple
const responses = await client.dlq.restart({
  dlqId: ["dlq-12345", "dlq-67890"],
  retries: 5,
});
```
