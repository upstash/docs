The `notify` method notifies workflows that are waiting for a specific event.

Workflows paused at a [`context.waitForEvent`](/workflow/basics/context/waitForEvent) step with the matching `eventId` will be resumed, and the provided `eventData` will be passed back to them.

## Arguments

<ParamField body="eventId" type="string" required>
    The identifier of the event to notify.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="eventData" type="any" optional>
    Data to deliver to the waiting workflow(s).
    This value will be returned in the `eventData` field of `context.waitForEvent`.
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns a list of `Waiter` objects representing the workflows that were notified:

  eventId: "my-event-id",
  eventData: "my-data", // data passed to the workflow run
});
