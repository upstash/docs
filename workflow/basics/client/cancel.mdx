## Usage

### Cancel a set of workflow runs

```ts
// cancel a single workflow
await client.cancel({ ids: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" });

// cancel a set of workflow runs
await client.cancel({ ids: ["<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_1>", "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_2>"] });
```

### Cancel workflow runs with URL filter

If you have an endpoint called `https://your-endpoint.com` and you
want to cancel all workflow runs on it, you can use `urlStartingWith`.

Note that this will cancel workflows in all endpoints under
`https://your-endpoint.com`.

```ts
await client.cancel({ urlStartingWith: "https://your-endpoint.com" });
```

### Cancel workflow runs with filters

Cancel all active workflows that match the provided filters:

```ts
// cancel workflows with a specific label
await client.cancel({
  filters: { label: "my-workflow-label" },
});

// cancel workflows within a date range
await client.cancel({
  filters: {
    fromDate: "1640995200000",
    toDate: "1672531200000",
  },
});

// combine filters
await client.cancel({
  filters: {
    label: "my-workflow-label",
    fromDate: "1640995200000",
    toDate: "1672531200000",
  },
});
```

### Cancel _all_ workflows

To cancel all pending and currently running workflows, you can
do it like this:

```ts
await client.cancel({ all: true });
```
