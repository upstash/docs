title: "client.cancel"
---

There are multiple ways you can cancel workflow runs:

- Pass one or more workflow run ids to cancel them
- Pass a workflow url to cancel all runs starting with this url
- cancel all pending or active workflow runs

## Arguments

<ParamField body="ids" type="array">
    The set of workflow run IDs you want to cancel
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="urlStartingWith" type="string">
    The URL address you want to filter while canceling
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="all" type="bool">
    Whether you want to cancel all workflow runs without any filter.
</ParamField>

## Usage

### Cancel a set of workflow runs

```ts
// cancel a single workflow
await client.cancel({ ids: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" });

// cancel a set of workflow runs
await client.cancel({ ids: ["<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_1>", "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_2>"] });
```

### Cancel workflow runs with URL filter

If you have an endpoint called `https://your-endpoint.com` and you
want to cancel all workflow runs on it, you can use `urlStartingWith`.

Note that this will cancel workflows in all endpoints under
`https://your-endpoint.com`.

```ts
await client.cancel({ urlStartingWith: "https://your-endpoint.com" });
```

### Cancel _all_ workflows

To cancel all pending and currently running workflows, you can
do it like this:

```ts
await client.cancel({ all: true });
```
