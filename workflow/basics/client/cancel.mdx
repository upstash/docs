There are multiple ways you can cancel workflow runs:

- Pass one or more workflow run ids to cancel them
- Pass a workflow url to cancel all runs with this exact url
- Pass a url prefix to cancel all runs starting with this url
- Pass filters (label, date range) to cancel matching workflow runs
- Cancel all pending or active workflow runs (by calling without any parameters)

## Returns

Returns an object with the number of cancelled workflows:

```ts
{
  cancelled: number;
}
```

## Usage

### Cancel a set of workflow runs

```ts
// cancel a single workflow
const result = await client.cancel({ ids: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" });
console.log(`Cancelled ${result.cancelled} workflow(s)`);

// cancel a set of workflow runs
const result = await client.cancel({
  ids: ["<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_1>", "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_2>"],
});
console.log(`Cancelled ${result.cancelled} workflow(s)`);
```

### Cancel workflow runs with exact URL

Cancel all workflow runs with a specific URL:

```ts
const result = await client.cancel({
  workflowUrl: "https://your-endpoint.com/api/workflow",
});
console.log(`Cancelled ${result.cancelled} workflow(s)`);
```

### Cancel workflow runs with URL prefix

If you have an endpoint called `https://your-endpoint.com` and you
want to cancel all workflow runs on it, you can use `urlStartingWith`.

Note that this will cancel workflows in all endpoints under
`https://your-endpoint.com`.

```ts
const result = await client.cancel({
  urlStartingWith: "https://your-endpoint.com",
});
console.log(`Cancelled ${result.cancelled} workflow(s)`);
```

### Cancel workflow runs with filters

Cancel all active workflows that match the provided filters:

```ts
// cancel workflows with a specific label
const result = await client.cancel({
  label: "my-workflow-label",
});

// cancel workflows within a date range
const result = await client.cancel({
  fromDate: "1640995200000",
  toDate: "1672531200000",
});

// combine multiple filters
const result = await client.cancel({
  label: "my-workflow-label",
  fromDate: "1640995200000",
  toDate: "1672531200000",
});

console.log(`Cancelled ${result.cancelled} workflow(s)`);
```

### Cancel _all_ workflows

To cancel all pending and currently running workflows, simply call cancel without any parameters:

```ts
const result = await client.cancel({});
console.log(`Cancelled ${result.cancelled} workflow(s)`);
```
