title: "Workflow Context"
---

A workflow's context is a JavaScript object provided by the serve function and is used to define your workflow endpoint. This context object offers utility methods for creating workflow steps, managing delays, and performing timeout-resistant HTTP calls.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve(
  // ðŸ‘‡ the workflow context
  async (context) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```

```python main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.post("/api/example")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...

```

</CodeGroup>

This context object provides utility methods to create workflow steps, wait for certain periods of time or perform timeout-resistant HTTP calls.

Further, the context object provides all request headers, the incoming request payload and current workflow ID.

## Context Object Properties

- `qstashClient`: QStash client used by the serve method

- `workflowRunId`: Current workflow run ID

- `url`: Publically accessible workflow endpoint URL

- `failureUrl`: URL for workflow failure notifications.

- `requestPayload`: Incoming request payload

- `rawInitialPayload`: String version of the initial payload

- `headers`: Request headers

- `env`: Environment variables

## Core Workflow Methods

### context.run

Defines and executes a workflow step.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Serial execution (TypeScript)
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<string>(async (context) => {
  const input = context.requestPayload;

  const result1 = await context.run("step-1", async () => {
    return someWork(input);
  });

  await context.run("step-2", async () => {
    someOtherWork(result1);
  });
});

```

```typescript Parallel execution (TypeScript)
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs"

export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    const input = context.requestPayload;

    const promise1 = context.run("step-1", async () => {
      return someWork(input);
    });

    const promise2 = context.run("step-2", async () => {
      return someOtherWork(input);
    });

    await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);
  },
);
```

```python Serial execution (Python)
from fastapi import FastAPI
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.post("/api/example")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    input = context.request_payload

    async def _step1():
        return some_work(input)

    result1 = await context.run("step-1", _step1)

    async def _step2():
        return some_other_work(result1)

    await context.run("step-2", _step2)

```

</CodeGroup>

### context.sleep

Pauses workflow execution for a specified duration.

<Tip>Always `await` a `sleep` action to properly pause execution.</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { signIn, sendEmail } from "@/utils/onboarding-utils";

export const { POST } = serve<User>(async (context) => {
  const userData = context.requestPayload;

  const user = await context.run("sign-in", async () => {
    const signedInUser = await signIn(userData);
    return signedInUser;
  });

  // ðŸ‘‡ Wait for one day (in seconds)
  await context.sleep("wait-until-welcome-email", "1d");

  await context.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
    return sendEmail(user.name, user.email);
  });
});
```

```python Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext
from onboarding_utils import sign_in, send_email

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.post("/api/onboarding")
async def onboarding(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[User]) -> None:
    user_data = context.request_payload

    async def _sign_in():
        return await sign_in(user_data)

    user = await context.run("sign-in", _sign_in)

    # ðŸ‘‡ Wait for one day (in seconds)
    await context.sleep("wait-until-welcome-email", "1d")

    async def _send_email():
        return await send_email(user.name, user.email)

    await context.run("send-welcome-email", _send_email)

```

</CodeGroup>

### context.sleepUntil

Pauses workflow execution until a specific timestamp.

<Tip>Always await a `sleepUntil` action to properly pause execution.</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { signIn, sendEmail } from "@/utils/onboarding-utils";

export const { POST } = serve<User>(async (context) => {
  const userData = context.requestPayload;

  const user = await context.run("sign-in", async () => {
    return signIn(userData);
  });

  // ðŸ‘‡ Calculate the date for one week from now
  const oneWeekFromNow = new Date();
  oneWeekFromNow.setDate(oneWeekFromNow.getDate() + 7);

  // ðŸ‘‡ Wait until the calculated date
  await context.sleepUntil("wait-for-one-week", oneWeekFromNow);

  await context.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
    return sendEmail(user.name, user.email);
  });
});
```

```python Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext
from onboarding_utils import sign_in, send_email

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.post("/api/onboarding")
async def onboarding(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[User]) -> None:
    user_data = context.request_payload

    async def _sign_in():
        return await sign_in(user_data)

    user = await context.run("sign-in", _sign_in)

    # ðŸ‘‡ Calculate the date for one week from now
    one_week_from_now = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7)

    # ðŸ‘‡ Wait until the calculated date
    await context.sleep_until("wait-for-one-week", one_week_from_now)

    async def _send_email():
        return await send_email(user.name, user.email)

    await context.run("send-welcome-email", _send_email)

```

</CodeGroup>

### context.call

Performs an HTTP call as a workflow step, allowing for longer response times.

Can take up to 15 minutes or 2 hours, depending on your [QStash plans](https://upstash.com/pricing/workflow) max HTTP connection timeout.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<{ topic: string }>(async (context) => {
  const request = context.requestPayload;

  const {
    status, // response status
    headers, // response headers
    body, // response body
  } = await context.call(
    "generate-long-essay", // Step name
    {
      url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", // Endpoint URL
      method: "POST",
      body: {
        // Request body
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a helpful assistant writing really long essays that would cause a normal serverless function to timeout.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: request.topic },
        ],
      },
      headers: {
        // request headers
        authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      },
    }
  );
});

```

```python Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from upstash_workflow.fastapi import Serve
from upstash_workflow import AsyncWorkflowContext

app = FastAPI()
serve = Serve(app)


@dataclass
class Request:
    topic: str


@serve.post("/api/example")
async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[Request]) -> None:
    request: Request = context.request_payload

    result = await context.call(
        "generate-long-essay",
        url="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        method="POST",
        body={
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant writing really long essays that would cause a normal serverless function to timeout.",
                },
                {"role": "user", "content": request["topic"]},
            ],
        },
        headers={
            "authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}",
        },
    )

    status, headers, body = result.status, result.headers, result.body

```

</CodeGroup>

If you want to call OpenAI, you can also use [`context.api.openai.call`](/workflow/basics/context#context-api).

<Tip>
  If the endpoint you request does not return a success response (status code 200-299),  
  `context.call` will still be treated as successful, and the workflow will continue executing.  
  As a result, `failureFunction` or `failureUrl` will not be invoked.

To handle non-success cases, you can check the `status` field in the response and implement custom logic as needed.

</Tip>

context.call parameters are:

- `url`: The URL to send the HTTP request to.
- `method`: The HTTP method to use for the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, etc.). Defaults to GET.
- `body`: Body to use in the request
- `headers`: An object representing the HTTP headers to include in the request.
- `retries`: The number of retry attempts to make if the request fails. [Retries use exponential backoff](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/retry). Defaults to 0 (no retries).
- `flowControl`: To limit the number of calls made to your endpoint. See [Flow Control](/workflow/howto/flow-control) for more details. The default is no limit.
    - `key`: The key to use for flow control.
    - `ratePerSecond`: The maximum number of calls per second.
    - `parallelism`: The maximum number of calls that can be active at the same time.
- `timeout`: The maximum duration to wait for a response from the endpoint, in seconds. If retries are enabled, this timeout applies individually to each retry attempt.

context.call attempts to parse the response body as JSON. If this is not possible, the body is returned as it is.

In TypeScript, you can declare the expected result type as follows:

```typescript
type ResultType = {
  field1: string,
  field2: number
};

const result = await context.call<ResultType>( ... );
```

<Note>
  The context.call method can make requests to any public API endpoint. However, it cannot:

  - Make requests to localhost (unless you set up a local tunnel, [here's how](http://localhost:3000/workflow/howto/local-development))
  - Make requests to internal Upstash QStash endpoints
</Note>

### context.api

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

In addition to context.call, another way to make third party requests is to use the context.api namespace. Under this namespace, you can find integrations for OpenAI, Anthropic and Resend.

With context.api, you can call the available integrations in a typesafe manner.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript OpenAI
const { status, body } = await context.api.openai.call("Call OpenAI", {
  token: "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
  operation: "chat.completions.create",
  body: {
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "Assistant says 'hello!'",
      },
      { role: "user", content: "User shouts back 'hi!'" },
    ],
  },
});
```

```typescript Anthropic
const { status, body } = await context.api.anthropic.call(
  "Call Anthropic",
  {
    token: "<ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>",
    operation: "messages.create",
    body: {
      model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      max_tokens: 1024,
      messages: [
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}
      ]
    },
  }
);
```

```typescript Resend
const { status, body } = await context.api.resend.call("Call Resend", {
  token: "<RESEND_API_KEY>",
  body: {
    from: "Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>",
    to: ["delivered@resend.dev"],
    subject: "Hello World",
    html: "<p>It works!</p>",
  },
  headers: {
    "content-type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

We are planning to add more integrations over time.

You can learn more about these integrations under the [integrations section](/workflow/integrations/openai).

### context.waitForEvent

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

Stops the workflow run until it is notified externally to continue.

There is also a timeout setting which makes the workflow continue if it's not notified within the time frame.

```javascript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<{ topic: string }>(async (context) => {
  const request = context.requestPayload;

  const {
    eventData, // data passed in notify
    timeout, // boolean denoting whether the step was notified or timed out
  } = await context.waitForEvent("wait for some event", "my-event-id", {
    timeout: "1000s", // 1000 second timeout
  });
});

```

Default timeout value is 7 days.

A workflow run waiting for event can be notified in two ways:

- `context.notify`: [Notify step explained below](/workflow/basics/context#context-notify)
- `client.notify`: [Notify method of the Workflow Client](/workflow/basics/client#notify-waiting-workflow).

### context.notify

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

Notifies workflows waiting for an event with some payload.

```javascript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<{ topic: string }>(async (context) => {
  const payload = context.requestPayload;

  const {
    notifyResponse, // result of notify, which is a list of notified waiters
  } = await context.notify("notify step", "my-event-Id", payload);
});

```

`notifyResponse` is a list of `NotifyResponse` objects:

```typescript
export type NotifyResponse = {
  waiter: Waiter;
  messageId: string;
  error: string;
};
```

More details about the `Waiter` object:

<Snippet file="qstash/waiter.mdx" />

### context.invoke

Triggers another workflow run and waits for its completion. 
The workflow continues when the invoked workflow finishes, whether successfully, with failure, or is canceled.
The `body` is the data returned by the invoked workflow, if any is returned.

```ts
const { body, isFailed, isCanceled } = await context.invoke(
  "invoke another workflow",
  {
    workflow: anotherWorkflow,
    body: "test",
    header: {...}, // headers to pass to anotherWorkflow (optional)
    retries,       // number of retries (optional, default: 3)
    flowControl,   // flow control settings (optional)
    workflowRunId  // workflowRunId to set (optional)
  }
);
```

Only workflows that served together can invoke each other. To learn more about how you can serve multiple workflows together,
checkout [Invoke other workflows](/workflow/howto/invoke) guide.

### context.cancel

<Note>
  This feature is not yet available in
  [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py). See our
  [Roadmap](/workflow/roadmap) for feature parity plans and
  [Changelog](/workflow/changelog) for updates.
</Note>

The methods we listed so far were all for defining a workflow step. `context.cancel` is different.

`context.cancel` allows you to cancel the current workflow:

```ts
export const { POST } = serve<{ topic: string }>(async (context) => {
  const payload = context.requestPayload

  const result = await context.run("check if canceled", () => { ... });

  if (result.cancel) {
    await context.cancel() // cancel the workflow run
  }
})
```

## Error handling and retries

- context.run automatically retries on failures. Default is 3 retries with exponential backoff.
- context.call doesn't retry by default. If you wish to add retry, you can use `retries` option.
- Future releases will allow more configuration of retry behavior.

## Limitations and Plan-Specific-Features

- Sleep durations and HTTP timeouts vary based on your QStash plan.
- See your plan's "Max Delay" and "Max HTTP Connection Timeout" for specific limits.
