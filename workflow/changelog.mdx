<Update label="January 2025">

    - Added the Agents API to workflows. You can now create AI agents to run workflows on your own infrastructure with all the benefits of workflows: reduced environment costs, fault tolerance, and scalability. Learn more about agents [here](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/agents/overview). 
    - For other bug fixes, see the full changelog [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/compare/v0.2.3...v0.2.6).

    - Released [`workflow-py`](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py).
- **Local Development Server:**  
    - The local development server is now available for public use. This server allows you to test your workflows locally. Learn more about the local development server [here](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/howto/local-development#development-server-recommended).    
- **Console:**
    - Separated Workflow and QStash consoles for a better user experience.
    - Separated their DLQ messages as well.
- **Workflow Server:**  
    - The core team focused on RateLimit and Parallelism features. These features are ready on the server and will be announced next month after the documentation and SDKs are completed.

<Update label="December 2024">  
- **TypeScript SDK (`workflow-js`):**  
    - Introduced third-party integrations, starting with Anthropic, Resend, and OpenAI. These integrations are automatically offloaded to workflows, ensuring long-running calls do not consume user environment time. See the related documentation [here](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/basics/context#context-api).  
    - Added a `timeout` parameter to `context.call`. Learn more in the [documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/basics/context#context-call).  
    - Improved support for workflows in Express and SvelteKit by adding the `useJSONContent` option.  
    - Resolved loop detection issues on Cloudflare and Render.  
    - Full changelog, including all fixes, is available [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.3).  

- **Workflow Server:**  
    - Added the `WorkflowCreatedAt` filter for Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and Events.  
    - Prepared the local development server for public release (coming soon).  
    - Enhanced `context.SleepUntil` to support float values.  
    - Increased the event retention period from 10,000 events to up to 14 days. Learn more on the [Pricing page](https://upstash.com/pricing/qstash).
