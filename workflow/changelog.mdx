<Update label="May 2025">
- **TypeScript SDK (`workflow-js`):**
    - Added a `workflow` parameter to `context.call`, enabling type-safe workflow calls. See [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/pull/75).
    - Enabled passing `context.call` settings when defining an Agent. See [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/pull/90).
    - Added `delay` support to `client.trigger`. See [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/pull/100).
    - Introduced `period` and improved `rate` support in flow control. See [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/pull/101).  
      Previously, `period` was fixed at 1 second. For example, `rate: 3 period: 1d` throttles publishes to 3 per day.
    - For additional bug fixes, see the full changelog [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/compare/v0.2.12...v0.2.13).
- **Workflow Server:** 
    - Added support for custom `period` in flow control, allowing users to set a period of up to 1 week.  
      Previously, `period` was fixed at 1 second. For example, `rate: 3 period: 1d` throttles publishes to 3 per day.
    - Implemented **Workflow Resume** and **Restart** features (SDK and Console support in progress):  
        - **Resume** allows users to retry a workflow run from the point it stopped.  
        - **Restart** allows users to retry a workflow run from the beginning.
- **Console:**
    - A major redesign is coming next month to improve Workflow usability.

    - Minor bug fixes.  
      See the full changelog [here](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1).
- **Workflow Server:** 
    - Prevented intermediate Workflow calls from failing due to request/message quota limits.
    - Fixed handling of `RUN_STARTED` so that it correctly returns unfinished Workflow Runs as documented.  
      Previously, some Workflow Runs could be skipped if internal state was logged after `RUN_STARTED`.
    - Applied several performance optimizations.
