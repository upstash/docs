title: "Bulk Cancel Workflows"
description: "Cancel multiple workflow runs" 
api: "DELETE https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/workflows/runs"
authMethod: "bearer"
---

Bulk cancel allows you to cancel multiple workflow runs at once.

<Warning>
If you provide a list of workflow run IDs in the request body, only those specific workflow runs will be canceled.

If you include the workflow URL parameter, all workflow runs matching the URL filter will be canceled.

If the request body is empty, all workflow runs will be canceled.
</Warning>

This operation scans all your workflow runs and attempts to cancel them.
If a specific workflow run cannot be canceled, it will return an error message.
Therefore, some workflow runs may not be cancelled at the end. 
In such cases, you can run the bulk cancel operation multiple times.
