You can fetch details about workflow runs, including their state, completed and in-progress steps, and step details.

The retention duration for completed workflow runs depends on your quota. Please check the [pricing](https://upstash.com/pricing/workflow) page for details.

<Note>
If you have executed multiple workflow runs with the same workflowRunId, the `workflowRunId` filter will return all of them.

To uniquely identify a single workflow run, include the `workflowCreatedAt` timestamp in your filter.
</Note>
