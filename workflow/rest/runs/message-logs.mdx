title: "List message logs"
description: "Fetch flat event logs of workflow runs"
api: "GET https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/workflows/messageLogs"
authMethod: "bearer"
---

<Warning>
  The message logs provide a more detailed version of the [List Workflow Runs
  API](/workflow/rest/runs/logs). If you need an overview of a workflow run,
  that API is more useful, as it returns grouped and processed data.
</Warning>

Each step in a workflow is associated with a message. During its lifecycle, a message generates multiple logs.

For example, when you trigger a workflow, a message is created to execute the first step of the workflow. This message logs a `CREATED` state and then waits to be processed by the server. Once successfully processed, it logs a `DELIVERED` state. Some data may be duplicated across these events.

In addition to logs generated by messages, we also generate some logs at the workflow run level. For instance, when a workflow is triggered, we log a `RUN_STATED` state. Similarly, we log `RUN_FAILED`, `RUN_SUCCESS`, and other states to track execution status.

The flat view returns all logs generated by a workflow run in their raw format. By checking the flat view, you can see all the lifecycle of workflow run.
