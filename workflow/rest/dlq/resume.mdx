title: "Resume Workflow Run"
description: "Resume a failed workflow run from where its left off"
api: "GET https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/dlq/resume/{dlqId}"
authMethod: "bearer"

When a workflow run fails, it's automatically moved to the DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) where it can be analyzed and resumed. 
The resume feature allows you to continue a failed workflow run from exactly where it failed, without re-executing successfully completed steps.

This is particularly useful for long-running workflows where you don't want to lose progress from successful steps when a single step fails.

When you resume a workflow, a fresh workflow run is created to avoid mixing failed and successful run states.
All data from successfully executed steps is maintained.

You can overwrite the workflow's run ID, retries and flow control settings by passing the respective headers in the resume request.

<Note>
    You can make changes to the workflow code as long as these changes come after the failed steps. 
    However, making changes before the failed step will break the code and is not allowed.

    For more details, check out [Handle workflow route code changes](/workflow/howto/changes) page.
