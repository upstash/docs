When a workflow run fails, it's automatically moved to the DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) where it can be analyzed and restarted. 
The restart feature allows you to start a failed workflow completely over from the beginning, re-executing all steps from scratch.

This is useful when you want to ensure a clean execution or when the workflow failure might have been caused by corrupted state that requires a fresh start.

When you restart a workflow,  completely new workflow run is created using the original workflow's initial configuration and payload.
All previous step results are discarded and the workflow executes as if it's running for the first time.

You can overwrite the retries and flow control settings by passing the respective headers in the restart request.
