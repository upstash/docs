## Using Workflow with another platform

If you'd like to use Upstash Workflow for a platform not listed above, you can do so using the base `serve` method:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow";
```

```python Python
from upstash_workflow import serve, async_serve
```

</CodeGroup>

and adjust this method for your platform. For details, see our platform-specific method implementations in [workflow-js](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/platforms) or [workflow-py](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py/tree/master/upstash_workflow).
