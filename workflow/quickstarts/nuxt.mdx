This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflow with Nuxt.js. You can also explore our [Nuxt example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/nuxt) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Installation

First, install the Workflow SDK in your Nuxt project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This token is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash Terminal
touch .env.local
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token:

```bash .env.local
QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:

## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint

A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.

To define a workflow endpoint in a Nuxt.js project, navigate into the Nuxt.js `server/api` directory and create a new file, for example called `workflow.ts`. This file will contain your workflow:

```typescript server/api/workflow.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/h3"

const { handler } = serve(
  async (context) => {
    await context.run("initial-step", () => {
      console.log("initial step ran")
    })

    await context.run("second-step", () => {
      console.log("second step ran")
    })
  },
)

export default handler;
```

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint

For QStash, a tool that's used to run workflows under the hood, you need to provide a live URL for your workflow endpoint. Here's how to [set up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).

Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:

### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)

Set your publically accessible URL as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:

```bash .env.local
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/
```

### Using the `baseUrl` option

As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` method. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:

```typescript server/api/workflow.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/h3"

const { handler } = serve(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    // no /api/workflow, just the base URL
    baseUrl: "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/",
  }
)

export default handler;
```

### Triggering the workflow

After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `baseUrl` option, trigger your workflow by first starting your Nuxt app:

```bash Terminal
npm run dev
```

and then making a POST request to your workflow endpoint. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:

```bash Terminal
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/api/workflow

# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```

<Frame>

  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/nextjs_local_request.png" />
</Frame>

Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.

## Step 5: Deploying to Production

When deploying your Nuxt.js application with Upstash Workflow to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables are set in your platforms project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN` and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.

2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production:

   ```typescript server/api/workflow.ts
   const { handler } = serve(
     async (context) => {
       // Your workflow steps
     },
     {
       // Conditionally set in development, but not in production
       // as the baseUrl is automatically set in production
       baseUrl:
         process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
           ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
           : undefined,
     }
   )
   export default handler;
   ```

3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Nuxt application to Vercel, Cloudflare Pages or other platforms as you normally would. These platforms will automatically detect and build your Nuxt application.

4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:

   ```bash Terminal
   curl -X POST https://<YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL>/api/workflow
   ```

5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.

6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
