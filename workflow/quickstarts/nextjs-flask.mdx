This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflow with Next.js & Flask. You can also explore [the source code](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py/tree/master/examples/nextjs-flask) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (or another package manager) installed.
3. Python and pip installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Setup

Clone the [Next.js & Flask example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py/tree/master/examples/nextjs-flask):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py.git
cd workflow-py/examples/nextjs-flask
```

## Step 2: Installation

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash Terminal
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This token is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash Terminal
touch .env
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token:

```bash .env
export QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:

<Note>
  This quickstart uses QStash production credentials for simplicity. However, we recommend using our local development server for development and testing once you're familiar with the basics.
  
  Our [local development guide](/workflow/howto/local-development) provides complete setup instructions for creating a sandboxed development environment.
</Note>

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

Upstash Workflow needs a public URL to orchestrate the workflow. Check out our [Local Development](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/howto/local-development) guide to learn how to set up a local tunnel.

Create the tunnel and set the `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file with the public URL:

```sh
ngrok http localhost:8000
```

```bash .env
export UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL="<your_ngrok_url>"
```

Don't forget to source your environment file to set your environment variables:

```bash Terminal
source .env
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your Next.js app in action.
Flask will be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Step 5: Deploying the Project at Vercel

To deploy the project at vercel and try the endpoints, you should start with setting up the project by running:

```bash Terminal
vercel
```

Next, you shoud go to vercel.com, find your project and add `QSTASH_TOKEN`, to the project as environment variables. You can find this env variables from the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash). To learn more about other env variables and their use in the context of Upstash Workflow, you can read [the Secure your Endpoint in our documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/howto/security#using-qstashs-built-in-request-verification-recommended).

Once you add the env variables, you can deploy the project with:

```bash Terminal
vercel --prod
```

Note that the project won't work in preview. It should be deployed to production like above. This is because preview requires authentication.

Once you have the app deployed, you can go to the deployment and call the endpoints using the form on the page.

You can observe the logs at [Upstash console under the Worfklow tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=workflow) or vercel.com to see your workflow operate.

## Next Steps

1. Learn how to protect your workflow endpoint from unauthorized access by [securing your workflow endpoint](/workflow/howto/security).

2. Explore [the source code](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/nextjs-flask) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.
