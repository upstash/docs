This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy
Upstash Workflow with Express.js. You can also explore our [Express.js example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/express)
for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Installation

First, install the Workflow SDK in your Express.js project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">```bash npm install @upstash/workflow ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">```bash pnpm install @upstash/workflow ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">```bash bun add @upstash/workflow ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This key is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash Terminal
touch .env
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token, as well as the environment you're running in:

```bash .env
QSTASH_TOKEN="***"
QSTASH_URL="***"

# if you are working on local environment
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=""
```

You can learn more about `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` from [our documentation on local development](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/howto/local-development).

Replace `***` with your actual QStash token and url found here:

## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint

A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.

To define a workflow endpoint with Express.js, navigate into your entrypoint file (usually `src/index.ts`) and add the following code:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Minimal example">
```typescript src/index.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/express";
import express from 'express';
import { config } from 'dotenv';

config();

const app = express();

app.use(
  express.json()
);

app.post(
  '/workflow',
  serve<{ message: string }>(
    async (context) => {
      const res1 = await context.run("step1", async () => {
        const message = context.requestPayload.message;
        return message;
      })

      await context.run("step2", async () => {
          console.log(res1);
      })
    }
  )
);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

````
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint

To start your Express.js app locally, run the following command:

```bash Terminal
npm run dev
````

Executing this command prints a local URL to your workflow endpoint. By default, this URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

Upstash Workflow is powered by [QStash](/qstash/overall/getstarted), and QStash needs a publicly accessible URL to run your workflows. You can easily forward your localhost URL to a live URL by following our guide about [setting up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).

Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:

### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)

Set your publically accessible URL (without extensions such as `/workflow`) as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:

```bash .env
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL="https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
```

### Using the `baseUrl` option

As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` method. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:

```typescript src/index.ts
app.post(
  '/workflow',
  serve<{ message: string }>(
    async (context) => { ... }, {
      // just the base URL, no `/workflow`
      baseUrl: 'https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/'
    }
  )
);

```

### Triggering the workflow

<Warning>Express.js integration only works with `Content-Type: application/json` header. Other payload types are not supported yet.</Warning>
After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `baseUrl` option, trigger your workflow by sending a POST request. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:

```bash Terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/workflow \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"message": "Hello from the workflow!"}'

# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/hono_local_request.png" />
</Frame>

Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.

## Step 5: Deploying to Production

When deploying your Hono app with Upstash Workflow to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables from your `.dev.vars` file are set in your Cloudflare Worker project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN`, and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.

2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production.

```typescript src/index.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/express";
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use(
    express.json()
);

app.use('/workflow',
	serve<{ message: string }>(async (context) => { ... }, {
		baseUrl: 'https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/'
	})
);

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

```

3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Express.js app to production as you normally would, for example to fly.io, Heroku, or AWS.

4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:

```bash Terminal
curl -X POST <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/workflow \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"message": "Hello from the workflow!"}'
```

5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.

6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
