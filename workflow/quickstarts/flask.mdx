This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use Upstash Workflow with Flask. You can also explore our [Flask example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-py/tree/master/examples/flask) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Python and pip installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Installation

First, create a new directory and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the Workflow SDK and Flask:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn upstash-workflow
```


## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This token is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash Terminal
touch .env.local
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token:

```bash .env.local
export QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:

<Note>
  This quickstart uses QStash production credentials for simplicity. However, we recommend using our local development server for development and testing once you're familiar with the basics.
  
  Our [local development guide](/workflow/howto/local-development) provides complete setup instructions for creating a sandboxed development environment.

## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint

A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.

To define a workflow endpoint in a Flask project, create a `main.py` file that contains your workflow:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Example">
```python main.py
from flask import Flask
from upstash_workflow.flask import Serve

app = Flask(__name__)
serve = Serve(app)


@serve.route("/api/workflow")
def workflow(context) -> None:
    def _step1() -> None:
        print("initial step ran")

    context.run("initial-step", _step1)

    def _step2() -> None:
        print("second step ran")

    context.run("second-step", _step2)

```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Sleep">
```python main.py
from flask import Flask
import time
from upstash_workflow.flask import Serve
from upstash_workflow import WorkflowContext

app = Flask(__name__)
serve = Serve(app)


def some_work(input: str) -> str:
    return f"processed '{input}'"


@serve.route("/sleep")
def sleep(context: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    input = context.request_payload

    def _step1() -> str:
        output = some_work(input)
        print("step 1 input", input, "output", output)
        return output

    result1: str = context.run("step1", _step1)

    context.sleep_until("sleep1", time.time() + 3)

    def _step2() -> str:
        output = some_work(result1)
        print("step 2 input", result1, "output", output)
        return output

    result2: str = context.run("step2", _step2)

    context.sleep("sleep2", 2)

    def _step3() -> None:
        output = some_work(result2)
        print("step 3 input", result2, "output", output)

    context.run("step3", _step3)

```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Call">
```python main.py
from flask import Flask
from typing import Dict
from upstash_workflow.flask import Serve
from upstash_workflow import WorkflowContext, CallResponse

app = Flask(__name__)
serve = Serve(app)


def some_work(input: str) -> str:
    return f"processed '{input}'"


@app.route("/get-data", methods=["POST"])
def get_data() -> Dict[str, str]:
    return {"message": "get data response"}


@serve.route("/call")
def call(context: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    input = context.request_payload

    def _step1() -> str:
        output = some_work(input)
        print("step 1 input", input, "output", output)
        return output

    result1: str = context.run("step1", _step1)

    response: CallResponse[Dict[str, str]] = context.call(
        "get-data",
        url=f"{context.env.get('UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL', 'http://localhost:8000')}/get-data",
        method="POST",
        body={"message": result1},
    )

    def _step2() -> str:
        output = some_work(response.body["message"])
        print("step 2 input", response, "output", output)
        return output

    context.run("step2", _step2)

```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Auth">
```python main.py
from flask import Flask
from upstash_workflow.flask import Serve
from upstash_workflow import WorkflowContext

app = Flask(__name__)
serve = Serve(app)


def some_work(input: str) -> str:
    return f"processed '{input}'"


@serve.route("/auth")
def auth(context: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
    if context.headers.get("Authentication") != "Bearer secret_password":
        print("Authentication failed.")
        return

    def _step1() -> str:
        return "output 1"

    context.run("step1", _step1)

    def _step2() -> str:
        return "output 2"

    context.run("step2", _step2)

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint

Upstash Workflow is powered by [QStash](/qstash/overall/getstarted), and QStash needs a publicly accessible URL to run your workflows. Here's how to [set up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).

Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:

### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)

Set your publically accessible URL as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:

```bash .env.local
export UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/
```

### Using the `base_url` option

As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `base_url` option in the `@serve.route` decorator. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:

```python main.py
@serve.route("/api/example", base_url="https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/")
def example(context: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None: ...

```

### Triggering the workflow

Don't forget to source your environment file to set your environment variables:

```bash Terminal
source .env.local
```

After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `base_url` option, trigger your workflow by first starting your Flask app:

```bash Terminal
flask --app main run -p 8000
```

and then making a POST request to your workflow endpoint. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:

```bash Terminal
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/api/workflow

# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```

See the [documentation on starting a workflow](/workflow/howto/start) for other ways you can start your workflow.

Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.
