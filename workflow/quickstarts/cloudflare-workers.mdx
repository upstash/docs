This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflow with Cloudflare Workers. You can also explore our [Cloudflare Workers example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/cloudflare-workers) or [Hono.js Cloudflare Workers example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/cloudflare-workers-hono) for detailed, end-to-end examples and best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.

If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.

## Step 1: Installation

First, install the Workflow SDK in your worker project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This key is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.

```bash Terminal
touch .dev.vars
```

Open the environment file and add your QStash token, as well as the environment you're running in:

```bash .dev.vars
QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:

## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint

A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.

To define a workflow endpoint with Cloudflare Workers, navigate into your workers entrypoint file (usually `src/index.ts`) and add the following code:

```typescript src/index.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/cloudflare"

interface Env {
  ENVIRONMENT: "development" | "production"
}

export default serve<{ text: string }>(
  async (context) => {
    const initialPayload = context.requestPayload.text

    const result = await context.run("initial-step", async () => {
        console.log(`Step 1 running with payload: ${initialPayload}`)

        return { text: "initial step ran" }
      }
    )

    await context.run("second-step", async () => {
      console.log(`Step 2 running with result from step 1: ${result.text}`)
    })
  }
)
```

## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint

To start your worker locally, run the following command:

```bash Terminal
npm run wrangler dev
```

Executing this command prints a local URL to your workflow endpoint. By default, this URL is `http://localhost:8787`.

You can verify your correct environment variable setup by checking the wrangler output, which should now have access to your `QSTASH_TOKEN` binding and log your local URL:

</Frame>

Upstash Workflow is powered by [QStash](/qstash/overall/getstarted), and QStash needs a publicly accessible URL to run your workflows. You can easily forward your localhost URL to a live URL by following our guide about [setting up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).

Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:

### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)

Set your publically accessible URL as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:

```bash .dev.vars
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/
```

### Using the `baseUrl` option

As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` method. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:

```typescript src/index.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/cloudflare"

interface Env {
  ENVIRONMENT: "development" | "production"
}

export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    const { fetch: handler } = serve(
      async (context) => { ... },
      {
        // publically accessible base url needed for local development
        baseUrl: env.ENVIRONMENT === "development"
          ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
          : undefined,
      }
    );
    return await handler(req, env)
  },
};
```

### Triggering the workflow

After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `baseUrl` option, trigger your workflow by sending a POST request. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:

```bash Terminal
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/ -D '{"text": "hello world!"}'

# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/workers_local_request.png" />
</Frame>

Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.

## Step 5: Deploying to Production

When deploying your Cloudflare Worker with Upstash Workflow to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables from your `.dev.vars` file are set in your Cloudflare Worker project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `ENVIRONMENT`, and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.

2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production:

```typescript src/index.ts
import { serve } from '@upstash/workflow/cloudflare'

interface Env {
  ENVIRONMENT: 'development' | 'production'
}

export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    const { fetch: handler } = serve(
      async (context) => { ... },
      {
        // baseUrl is not necessary in production
        baseUrl: env.ENVIRONMENT === 'development'
          ? 'https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/'
          : undefined,
      },
    );
    return await handler(req, env);
  },
}
```

3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Cloudflare Worker to production as you normally would, for example using the Cloudflare CLI:

   ```bash Terminal
   wrangler deploy
   ```

4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:

   ```bash Terminal
   curl -X POST https://<YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL>/ -D '{"text": "hello world!"}'
   ```

5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.

6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
