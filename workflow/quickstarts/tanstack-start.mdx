This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use Upstash Workflow with TanStack Start. You can also explore [the source code](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/tanstack-start) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and pnpm installed.

You can integrate Upstash Workflow into an existing TanStack Start app, or create a new TanStack Start project from scratch.

## Step 1: Create a new TanStack Start project

Run the following command to create a new TanStack Start project:

```bash
pnpm create @tanstack/start@latest
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

## Step 2: Installation

Run the following command to install the Upstash Workflow SDK in your TanStack Start app.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Run the development server

Upstash Workflow is built on top of Upstash QStash.

In a production environment, your application connects to the managed QStash servers hosted by Upstash.
This ensures that requests are delivered reliably, securely, and at scale without requiring you to run and maintain your own infrastructure.

For local development, you don't need to depend on the managed QStash servers. Instead, you can run a local QStash server directly on your machine.
This local server behaves just like the production version but does not require external network calls.

Start the local server with:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpx @upstash/qstash-cli dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npx @upstash/qstash-cli dev
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When the server starts, it will print the credentials.
You'll need these values in the next step to connect your TanStack Start app to QStash.

You can enable local mode in the Upstash Workflow dashboard to use the UI while developing locally.

</Frame>

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Next, you need to configure your TanStack Start app to connect with the local QStash server by setting environment variables.

In the root of your project, create a `.env` file (or update your existing one) and add the values printed by the QStash local server:

```txt
QSTASH_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
QSTASH_TOKEN="eyJVc2VySUQiOiJkZWZhdWx0VXNlciIsIlBhc3N3b3JkIjoiZGVmYXVsdFBhc3N3b3JkIn0="
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_7kYjw48mhY7kAjqNGcy6cr29RJ6r"
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_5ZB6DVzB1wjE8S6rZ7eenA8Pdnhs"
```

<Tip>
  For production, replace these with your actual credentials from the Upstash Workflow dashboard.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Create a Workflow Endpoint

With your environment ready, the next step is to define your first workflow endpoint.

In Upstash Workflow, every workflow is exposed as an endpoint. 
Every endpoint you expose using the SDK's `serve()` function acts as a workflow that can be triggered independently.

In TanStack Start, these endpoints are implemented as **API routes** using the file-based routing system.

Create a new file `src/routes/api/workflow.ts`:

```typescript src/routes/api/workflow.ts
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { serve } from '@upstash/workflow/tanstack'

const someWork = (input: string) => {
  return `processed '${JSON.stringify(input)}'`
}

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/workflow')({
  server: {
    handlers: serve<string>(async (context) => {
      const input = context.requestPayload
      
      const result1 = await context.run('step1', () => {
        const output = someWork(input)
        console.log('step 1 input', input, 'output', output)
        return output
      })

      await context.run('step2', () => {
        const output = someWork(result1)
        console.log('step 2 input', result1, 'output', output)
      })
    }),
  },
})
```

## Step 6: Start your TanStack Start app

Start your TanStack Start development server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 7: Run the Workflow Endpoint

Once your endpoint is defined, the next step is to trigger a workflow run.

You can start a new workflow run using the `trigger()` function from the Upstash Workflow SDK. 

```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = Client()

const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/api/workflow`,
  body: "Hello World!",
  retries: 3,
  keepTriggerConfig: true,
});
```

<Info>
  The `trigger()` function should typically be called from a server-side action (not directly in client-side code) to keep your credentials secure.
</Info>

Check the Upstash Workflow dashboard to view logs of your workflow run:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/qstash-workflow/run-view.png" alt="Debug a workflow run on UI" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
Inside the `trigger()` call, you need to provide the URL of your workflow endpoint:

- Local development → use the URL where your app is running, for example: http://localhost:3000/api/workflow
- Production → use the URL of your deployed app, for example: https://yourapp.com/api/workflow

To avoid hardcoding URLs, you can define a `BASE_URL` constant and set it based on the environment:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? 'https://yourapp.com'
  : 'http://localhost:3000'

const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: `${BASE_URL}/api/workflow`,
  body: "Hello World!",
  retries: 3,
  keepTriggerConfig: true,
});
```
</Tip>
