When you define a workflow endpoint, you can attach a failure function to the workflow that allows you to execute custom logic when a workflow run fails after exhausting all retry attempts.

This feature ensures that you can perform cleanup operations, logging, alerting, or any other custom error handling logic before the failed workflow run is moved to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

</Frame>

The failure function automatically receives the workflow run context and the reason for the failure, so you can decide how to handle it.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";

export const { POST } = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    // Your workflow logic...
  },
  {
    failureFunction: async ({
      context,
      failStatus,
      failResponse,
      failHeaders,
    }) => {

      // 👇 Log error to monitoring system
      await logToSentry(...);

      // 👇 Send alert to team
      await sendSlackAlert(...);

      // 👇 Perform cleanup operations
      await cleanupWorkflowResources(...);
    },
  }
```
);

</CodeGroup>

You cannot create new workflow steps inside the `failureFunction` using `context`.
The `context` provided here is only meant to expose workflow run properties (like URL, payload, and headers).
Think of the failure function as an individual `context.run` step. It executes once with the provided context but cannot define further steps.

<Info>
    If you use a custom authorization method to secure your workflow endpoint, add authorization to the `failureFunction` too.
    Otherwise, anyone could invoke your failure function with a request.
