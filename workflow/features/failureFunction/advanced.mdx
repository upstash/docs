title: "Advanced failureUrl Option"
---

The `failureUrl` is an advanced option that sends failure callback to a different endpoint rather than to the workflow endpoint.
This approach is useful for handling failures on separate infrastructure.

<Tip>You can use either `failureFunction` or `failureUrl`, but not both. These options are mutually exclusive.</Tip>

For most users, `failureFunction` is the better choice because:
- It runs alongside your workflow and has access to the same context and dependencies
- Failure function requests are automatically retried on failure
- You can manually retry failure function if it fails from the Dead Letter Queue later

If you think this advanced option fits your need, you can configure it by passing `failureUrl` configuration.

    ```typescript TypeScript
    export const { POST } = serve<string>(
      async (context) => {
        // Your workflow logic...
      },
      {
        failureUrl: "https://<YOUR_FAILURE_URL>/workflow-failure",
      }
    );
    ```

    ```python Python
    @serve.post("/api/example", failure_url="https://<YOUR_FAILURE_URL>/workflow-failure")
    async def example(context: AsyncWorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
        # Your workflow logic...
        pass
    ```
