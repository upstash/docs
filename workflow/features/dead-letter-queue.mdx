The **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** automatically captures failed workflow runs that have exhausted all retry attempts.

This ensures that no workflow execution is lost and provides multiple options for recovering from failures gracefully.

## How it works?

When a workflow step fails and exhausts all configured retries, Upstash Workflow automatically moves the failed run to the DLQ.
This happens automatically without any additional configuration required.

The DLQ serves as a safety net, preserving failed workflow runs with their complete execution context.

<Note>
  Dead Letter Queue entries have a retention period. After the retention duration expires, DLQ items are automatically removed and cannot be recovered.

## Recovery Actions

Once a workflow run is in the DLQ, you can take the following actions:

- **[Restart](/workflow/features/dead-letter-queue)** – trigger the workflow from the beginning.
- **[Resume](/workflow/features/dead-letter-queue)** – continue the workflow from the point of failure.
- **[Re-run Failure Function](/workflow/features/dead-letter-queue)** – execute the workflow’s failure handling logic again.
- or delete the DLQ entry if no action is required.

You can apply these actions in bulk to multiple DLQ entries. Check the individual action pages for more details.
