title: "Restart"
---

The **Restart** action allows you to re-execute a failed workflow run from the beginning.
All previous step results are discarded, and the workflow executes from scratch using the original configuration and initial payload.

This approach is ideal when:

- Previous step results are no longer relevant.
- The failure was caused by corrupted or inconsistent state.
- You need a completely fresh execution with updated or clean data.

    -H "Upstash-Workflow-RunId: my-restarted-workflow-XYZ"
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<WORKFLOW_TOKEN>" });
    const result = await client.restartFromDLQ("dlq_XYZ", {
      workflowRunId: "my-restarted-workflow-XYZ"
    });
