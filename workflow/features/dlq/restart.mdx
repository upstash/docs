title: "Restart"

The **Restart** action allows you to re-execute a failed workflow run from the beginning.
All previous step results are discarded, and the workflow executes from scratch using the original configuration and initial payload.

This approach is ideal when:

- Previous step results are no longer relevant.
- The failure was caused by corrupted or inconsistent state.
- You need a completely fresh execution with updated or clean data.

You can perform this action programmatically as well:

<CodeGroup>
    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<WORKFLOW_TOKEN>" });

    await client.dlq.restart({
      dlqId: "dlq-12345",
      retries: 3,
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>
