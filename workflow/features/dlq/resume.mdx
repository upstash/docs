title: "Resume"
---

The **Resume** action allows you to continue a failed workflow run from the exact point of failure, preserving all successfully completed steps and their results.

This approach is ideal when:

- The workflow has long-running or resource-intensive steps that have already succeeded.
- You want to preserve progress and avoid re-executing successful operations.
- The failure was a temporary issue that can now be resolved.

You can perform this action programmatically as well:

<CodeGroup>
    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<WORKFLOW_TOKEN>" });

    await client.dlq.resume({
      dlqId: "dlq-12345",
      retries: 3,
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    You can modify workflow code as long as changes occur **after** the failed steps.
    Changes to steps prior to the failure are not allowed and may break the workflow.
