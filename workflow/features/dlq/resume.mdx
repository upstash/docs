title: "Resume"
---

The **Resume** action allows you to continue a failed workflow run from the exact point of failure, preserving all successfully completed steps and their results.

This approach is ideal when:

- The workflow has long-running or resource-intensive steps that have already succeeded.
- You want to preserve progress and avoid re-executing successful operations.
- The failure was a temporary issue that can now be resolved.

    ```bash Bash
    curl -X GET https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/dlq/resume/dlq_XYZ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    -H "Upstash-Workflow-RunId: my-resumed-workflow-XYZ"
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<WORKFLOW_TOKEN>" });
    const result = await client.resumeFromDLQ("dlq_XYZ", {
      workflowRunId: "my-resumed-workflow-XYZ"
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    You can modify workflow code as long as changes occur **after** the failed steps.
    Changes to steps prior to the failure are not allowed and may break the workflow.
