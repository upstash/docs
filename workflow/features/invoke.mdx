You can start another workflow run inside a workflow and await its execution to complete.
This allows to orchestrate multiple workflows together without external synchronization.

When you use `context.invoke`, invoking workflow will wait until the invoked workflow finishes before running the next step.

```typescript
const {
  body,      // response from the invoked workflow
  isFailed,  // whether the invoked workflow was canceled
  isCanceled // whether the invoked workflow failed
} = await context.invoke(
  "analyze-content",
  {
    workflow: analyzeContent,
    body: "test",
    header: {...}, // headers to pass to anotherWorkflow (optional)
    retries,       // number of retries (optional, default: 3)
    flowControl,   // flow control settings (optional)
    workflowRunId  // workflowRunId to set (optional)
  }
)
```

You can return a response from a workflow, which will be delivered to invoker workflow run.

<Note>
    You cannot create an infinite chain of workflow invocations. If you set up an 'invoke loop' where workflows continuously invoke each other, the process will fail once it reaches a depth of 100.
