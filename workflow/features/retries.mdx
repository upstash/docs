Upstash Workflow provides automatic retry mechanisms to ensure your workflows are reliable and resilient to temporary failures. 
Workflow automatically handles transient errors such as network issues or service unavailability.

## How Retries Work

When a step fails, Upstash Workflow automatically retries the failed step with configurable retry attempts and delays to allow temporary outages to resolve.

</Frame>

By default, retry count is set to 3 and exponential delay is used.

```javascript Default Backoff Algorithm
// n = how many times this request has been retried
delay = min(86400, e ** (2.5*n)) // in seconds
```

| Retry Attempt | Algorithm  | Delay    |
|---------------| ----- |----------|
| 1             | $$e^{2.5}$$ | 12s      |
| 2             | $$e^5$$| 2m28s    |
| 3             | $$e^{7.5}$$| 30m8s    |
| 4+            | $$86400$$| 24h      |
