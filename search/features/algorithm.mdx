Upstash Search combines semantic search with traditional full-text search
for accurate and relevant results. That way, Upstash Search captures what users mean (also known as [search intent](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/search-intent)), while still matching important keywords.

Together, both approaches let Upstash Search:
- Understand what users are trying to find, even if they don't word it perfectly
- Find documents with related or alternative phrasing
- Work across all kinds of content and domains

Behind the scenes, user queries get a subtle boost from large language models,
helping the system better understand context and return smarter results
even when queries are vague or incomplete.
