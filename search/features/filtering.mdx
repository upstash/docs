title: Filtering with Fields
---

You can further restrict the search by providing a filter based on a specific fields.

Search queries with filters only return documents which have the fields matching with the filter.

Upstash Search allows you to filter fields which have the following value types:

- string
- number
- boolean
- object
- array

Filtering is implemented as a combination of in and post-filtering. Every query is assigned a filtering budget, 
determining the number of candidate documents that can be compared against the filter during query execution. If this
budget is exceeded, the system fallbacks into post-filtering. Therefore, with highly selective filters, fewer 
than `topK` documents may be returned.

## Filter Syntax

A filter has a syntax that resembles SQL, which consists of operators on field keys and boolean operators
to combine them.

Assuming you have fields like below:

```json
{
    "city": "Istanbul",
    "country": "Turkey",
    "is_capital": false,
    "population": 15460000,
    "geography": {
        "continent": "Asia",
        "coordinates": {
            "latitude": 41.0082,
            "longitude": 28.9784
        }
    },
    "economy": {
        "currency": "TRY",
        "major_industries": [
            "Tourism",
            "Textiles",
            "Finance"
        ]
    }
}
```

Then, you can search similar documents with a filter like below:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">```python # Placeholder for Python example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">```ts // Placeholder for JavaScript example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="curl">```shell # Placeholder for curl example ```</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Operators

#### Equals (=)

The `equals` operator filters fields whose values are equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population = 15460000 AND is_capital = false
```

#### Not Equals (!=)

The `not equals` operator filters fields whose values are not equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
country != 'Germany' AND population != 12500000 AND is_capital != true
```

#### Less Than (\<)

The `less than` operator filters fields whose values are less than the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
population < 20000000 OR geography.coordinates.longitude < 30.0
```

#### Less Than or Equals (\<=)

The `less than or equals` operator filters fields whose values are less than or equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
population <= 20000000 OR geography.coordinates.longitude <= 30.0
```

#### Greater Than (>)

The `greater than` operator filters fields whose values are greater than the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
population > 10000000 OR geography.coordinates.latitude > 39.5
```

#### Greater Than or Equals (>=)

The `greater than or equals` operator filters fields whose values are greater than or equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
population >= 10000000 OR geography.coordinates.latitude >= 39.5
```

#### Glob

The `glob` operator filters fields whose values match with the given UNIX glob pattern.

It is applicable to _string_ values.

It is a case sensitive operator.

The glob operator supports the following wildcards:

- `*` matches zero or more characters.
- `?` matches exactly one character.
- `[]` matches one character from the list
    - `[abc]` matches either `a`, `b`, or `c`.
    - `[a-z]` matches one of the range of characters from `a` to `z`.
    - `[^abc]` matches any one character other than `a`, `b`, or `c`.
    - `[^a-z]` matches any one character other than `a` to `z`.

For example, the filter below would only match with city names whose second character is `s` or `z`,
and ends with anything other than `m` to `z`.

```SQL
city GLOB '?[sz]*[^m-z]'
```

#### Not Glob

The `not glob` operator filters fields whose values do not match with the given UNIX glob pattern.

It is applicable to _string_ values.

It has the same properties with the glob operator.

For example, the filter below would only match with city names whose first character is anything other than `A`.

```SQL
city NOT GLOB 'A*'
```

#### In

The `in` operator filters fields whose values are equal to any of the given literals.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
country IN ('Germany', 'Turkey', 'France')
```

Semantically, it is equivalent to equals operator applied to all of the given literals with `OR` boolean operator in between:

```SQL
country = 'Germany' OR country = 'Turkey' OR country = 'France'
```

#### Not In

The `not in` operator filters fields whose values are not equal to any of the given literals.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
economy.currency NOT IN ('USD', 'EUR')
```

Semantically, it is equivalent to not equals operator applied to all of the given literals with `AND` boolean operator in between:

```SQL
economy.currency != 'USD' AND economy.currency != 'EUR'
```

#### Contains

The `contains` operator filters fields whose values contain the given literal.

It is applicable to _array_ values.

```SQL
economy.major_industries CONTAINS 'Tourism'
```

#### Not Contains

The `not contains` operator filters fields whose values do not contain the given literal.

It is applicable to _array_ values.

```SQL
economy.major_industries NOT CONTAINS 'Steel Production'
```

#### Has Field

The `has field` operator filters fields which have the given JSON field.

```SQL
HAS FIELD geography.coordinates
```

#### Has Not Field

The `has not field` operator filters fields which do not have the given JSON field.


```SQL
HAS NOT FIELD geography.coordinates.longitude
```

### Boolean Operators

Operators above can be combined with `AND` and `OR` boolean operators to form
compound filters.

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000
```

Boolean operators can be grouped with parentheses to have higher precedence.

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND (population > 10000000 OR is_capital = false)
```

When no parentheses are provided in ambiguous filters, `AND` will have higher
precedence than `OR`. So, the filter

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000 OR is_capital = false
```

would be equivalent to

```SQL
(country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000) OR is_capital = false
```

### Filtering Nested Objects

It is possible to filter nested object fields by referencing them with the `.` accessor.

Nested fields can be at arbitrary depths, so more than one `.` accessor can be used
in the same identifier.

```SQL
economy.currency != 'USD' AND geography.coordinates.latitude >= 35.0
```

### Filtering Array Elements

Apart from the `CONTAINS` and `NOT CONTAINS` operators, individual array elements can also
be filtered by referencing them with the `[]` accessor by their indexes.

Indexing is zero based.

```SQL
economy.major_industries[0] = 'Tourism'
```

Also, it is possible to index from the back using the `#` character with negative values.
`#` can be thought as the number of elements in the array, so `[#-1]` would reference the
last element.

```SQL
economy.major_industries[#-1] = 'Finance'
```

### Miscellaneous

- Identifiers (the left side of the operators) should be of the form `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9.[\]#-]*`. In simpler terms, they should
start with characters from the English alphabet or `_`, and can continue with same characters plus numbers and other accessors
like `.`, `[0]`, or `[#-1]`.
- The string literals (strings in the right side of the operators) can be either single or double quoted.
- Boolean literals are represented as `1` or `0`.
- The operators, boolean operators, and boolean literals are case insensitive.
