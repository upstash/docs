title: Filtering
---

Search queries with filters only return documents which have the content matching with the filter.

Upstash Search allows you to filter by content keys which have the following value types:

- string
- number
- boolean
- object
- array

Filtering is implemented as a combination of in and post-filtering. Every query is assigned a filtering budget,
determining the number of candidate documents that can be compared against the filter during query execution. If this
budget is exceeded, the system fallbacks into post-filtering. Therefore, with highly selective filters, fewer
than `topK` documents may be returned.

---

## Filter Syntax

A filter has a syntax that resembles SQL, which consists of operators on content keys and boolean operators
to combine them.

Assuming you have content like below:

```typescript
{
  // ðŸ‘‡ searchable and filterable
  content: {
    name: "Wireless Headphones",
    description: "Noise-cancelling bluetooth headphones",
    brand: "Sony",
    category: "Electronics",
    warehouse_location: "A3-15",
    in_stock: 3
  },
  // ðŸ‘‡ not searchable, for reference only
  metadata: {
    sku: "AT-WH-001",
    supplier_id: "SUP-123",
  }
}
```

Filter documents like so:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
```py
scores = index.search(
    query="sony headphones",
    filter="warehouse_location = 'A3-15'",
)
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```ts
const searchResults = await index.search({
    query: "sony headphones",
    filter: "warehouse_location = 'A3-15'",
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### TypeSafe Filters (TypeScript)

In our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/upstash/search-js), we support a typesafe way to build filters:

```ts
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";

type IndexContent = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  brand: string;
  category: string[];
  warehouse_location: string;
  in_stock: number;
};

const client = new Client({ ... });
const index = client.index<IndexContent>("products");

const searchResults = await index.search({
  query: "sony headphones",
  filter: { category: { contains: 'electronics' } },
});
```

<Note>
  Note that we passed `IndexContent` as a type parameter to the `index` method. This allows the SDK to infer the types of the content and metadata, enabling type-safe filters.
</Note>


You can use the `AND` and `OR` operators to build complex filters.

<CodeGroup>

```ts AND
const searchResults = await index.search({
  query: "sony headphones",
  filter: {
    AND: [
      { warehouse_location: { equals: 'A3-15' } },
      { in_stock: { greaterThan: 0 } }
    ]
  },
});
```

```ts OR
const searchResults = await index.search({
  query: "sony headphones",
  filter: {
    OR: [
      { warehouse_location: { equals: 'A3-15' } },
      { in_stock: { greaterThan: 0 } }
    ]
  },
});
```

```ts Nested AND/OR
const searchResults = await index.search({
  query: "sony headphones",
  filter: {
    AND: [
      { category: { contains: 'electronics' } },
      { OR: [
        { warehouse_location: { equals: 'A3-15' } },
        { in_stock: { greaterThan: 0 } }
      ]}
    ]
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>


All the operations below except for filtering array elements and nested objects are supported in the typesafe filters.

---

## Operators

#### Equals (=)

The `equals` operator filters content whose values are equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
warehouse_location = 'A3-15' AND in_stock = 3
```

---

#### Not Equals (!=)

The `not equals` operator filters content whose values are not equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
warehouse_location != 'A3-15' AND in_stock != 3
```

---

#### Less Than (\<)

The `less than` operator filters content whose values are less than the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
in_stock < 3
```

---

#### Less Than or Equals (\<=)

The `less than or equals` operator filters content whose values are less than or equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
in_stock <= 3
```

---

#### Greater Than (>)

The `greater than` operator filters content whose values are greater than the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
in_stock > 3
```

---

#### Greater Than or Equals (>=)

The `greater than or equals` operator filters content whose values are greater than or equal to the given literal.

It is applicable to _number_ values.

```SQL
in_stock >= 3
```

---

#### Glob

The `glob` operator filters content whose values match with the given UNIX glob pattern.

It is applicable to _string_ values.

It is a case sensitive operator.

The glob operator supports the following wildcards:

- `*` matches zero or more characters.
- `?` matches exactly one character.
- `[]` matches one character from the list
  - `[abc]` matches either `a`, `b`, or `c`.
  - `[a-z]` matches one of the range of characters from `a` to `z`.
  - `[^abc]` matches any one character other than `a`, `b`, or `c`.
  - `[^a-z]` matches any one character other than `a` to `z`.

For example, the filter below would only match with warehouse locations whose first character is `A` or `B`.

```SQL
warehouse_location GLOB '[AB]*'
```

---

#### Not Glob

The `not glob` operator filters content whose values do not match with the given UNIX glob pattern.

It is applicable to _string_ values.

It has the same properties with the glob operator.

For example, the filter below would only match with warehouse locations whose first character is anything other than `A`.

```SQL
warehouse_location NOT GLOB 'A*'
```

---

#### In

The `in` operator filters content whose values are equal to any of the given literals.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
country IN ('Germany', 'Turkey', 'France')
```

Semantically, it is equivalent to equals operator applied to all of the given literals with `OR` boolean operator in between:

```SQL
country = 'Germany' OR country = 'Turkey' OR country = 'France'
```

---

#### Not In

The `not in` operator filters content whose values are not equal to any of the given literals.

It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.

```SQL
economy.currency NOT IN ('USD', 'EUR')
```

Semantically, it is equivalent to not equals operator applied to all of the given literals with `AND` boolean operator in between:

```SQL
economy.currency != 'USD' AND economy.currency != 'EUR'
```

---

#### Contains

The `contains` operator filters content whose values contain the given literal.

It is applicable to _array_ values.

```SQL
economy.major_industries CONTAINS 'Tourism'
```

---

#### Not Contains

The `not contains` operator filters content whose values do not contain the given literal.

It is applicable to _array_ values.

```SQL
economy.major_industries NOT CONTAINS 'Steel Production'
```

---

#### Has Field

The `has field` operator filters content which have the given JSON field.

```SQL
HAS FIELD geography.coordinates
```

---

#### Has Not Field

The `has not field` operator filters content which do not have the given JSON field.

```SQL
HAS NOT FIELD geography.coordinates.longitude
```

---

### Boolean Operators

Operators above can be combined with `AND` and `OR` boolean operators to form
compound filters.

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000
```

Boolean operators can be grouped with parentheses to have higher precedence.

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND (population > 10000000 OR is_capital = false)
```

When no parentheses are provided in ambiguous filters, `AND` will have higher
precedence than `OR`. So, the filter

```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000 OR is_capital = false
```

would be equivalent to

```SQL
(country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000) OR is_capital = false
```

---

### Filtering Nested Objects

It is possible to filter nested object fields by referencing them with the `.` accessor.

Nested fields can be at arbitrary depths, so more than one `.` accessor can be used
in the same identifier.

```SQL
economy.currency != 'USD' AND geography.coordinates.latitude >= 35.0
```

---

### Filtering Array Elements

Apart from the `CONTAINS` and `NOT CONTAINS` operators, individual array elements can also
be filtered by referencing them with the `[]` accessor by their indexes.

Indexing is zero based.

```SQL
economy.major_industries[0] = 'Tourism'
```

Also, it is possible to index from the back using the `#` character with negative values.
`#` can be thought as the number of elements in the array, so `[#-1]` would reference the
last element.

```SQL
economy.major_industries[#-1] = 'Finance'
```

---

### Miscellaneous

- Identifiers (the left side of the operators) should be of the form `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9.[\]#-]*`. In simpler terms, they should
  start with characters from the English alphabet or `_`, and can continue with same characters plus numbers and other accessors
  like `.`, `[0]`, or `[#-1]`.
- The string literals (strings in the right side of the operators) can be either single or double quoted.
- Boolean literals are represented as `1` or `0`.
- The operators, boolean operators, and boolean literals are case insensitive.
