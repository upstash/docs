title: What is Upstash Search?
description: Lightweight, AI-powered search for developers
---

Upstash Search is a **simple, lightweight, and scalable way to add AI-powered search to your app**. 

We combine full-text and semantic search for highly relevant results. Search works out of the box and scales to massive data sizes with zero infrastructure to manage.

## Lightweight & Efficient

Most search products (we'll avoid names here 💀) are bloated, complicated, and hard to manage. We're building Upstash search to be the exact opposite: fast to set up, easy to use and optimized for real-world use cases.

- Set up in minutes
- Plug-and-play AI search with smart defaults
- Optimized for speed and simplicity

## Fast, Relevant Results

We have a deep understanding of LLM technology through [Upstash Vector](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/whatisvector) and hosting our own models at scale. We're now using that experience to make search feel truly intelligent. While most search products add AI to catch up, we're making it a core part of Upstash Search from the start.

- Combines semantic & full-text search for relevancy
- Understands user search intent
- Smart ranking shows the best matches first

---

## Scales Automatically

We've scaled [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted) to serve billions of requests each day with extremely high availability. That same experience is built into Search, so you never have to think about infra. 

We're building Search for modern, serverless stacks from the ground up. It's ready for any data size you throw at it.

- Perfect for serverless apps and modern frameworks like Next.js
- Scales to any data size (seriously, we've indexed the entire Wikipedia in 7 languages)
- No infrastructure, clusters or servers to manage
