description: a CLI tool to migrate your data to Upstash Search
---

## Introduction

This tool helps you to migrate your data from other service providers (e.g. Algolia, Meilisearch)
to your Upstash Search Database.

### Migrate Using npx
The command below prompts you to provide credentials for the indexes that you want to do the migration between.

```sh
npx @upstash/search-migrator
```

### Using Flags

You can also provide your credentials and other information as command-line flags.
Here are some examples:

#### Algolia to Upstash

```sh
npx @upstash/search-migrator \
  --upstash-url "UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL" \
  --upstash-token "UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN" \
  --algolia-app-id "YOUR_ALGOLIA_APP_ID" \
  --algolia-api-key "YOUR_ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY"
```

#### Meilisearch to Upstash

```sh
npx @upstash/search-migrator \
  --upstash-url "UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL" \
  --upstash-token "UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN" \
  --meilisearch-host "YOUR_MEILISEARCH_HOST" \
  --meilisearch-api-key "YOUR_MEILISEARCH_API_KEY"
```

## Obtaining Credentials

### Upstash

1. Go to your [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/).
2. Select your Search Database.
3. Under the **Details** section, you will find your `UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN`.
   - `--upstash-url` corresponds to `UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL`.
   - `--upstash-token` corresponds to `UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN`.

## Migration Process

The migrator will:

1. **Connect** to your source database (Algolia or Meilisearch)
2. **Fetch** all documents from the specified index
3. **Transform** the data to match Upstash Search's format
4. **Upload** the documents to your Upstash Search database
5. **Verify** the migration by comparing document counts

### Data Transformation

The migrator automatically handles the transformation of your data:

- **Document IDs**: Preserved from the source
- **Content**: Mapped to Upstash Search's content field
- **Metadata**: Preserved as metadata in Upstash Search
- **Searchable fields**: All fields become searchable by default


<Note>
  For free tier, 10000 documents can be upserted daily, 
  so a database migration with more than 10000 entries could
  be interrupted.
</Note>

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during migration:

1. Check the error messages for specific details
2. Verify your credentials are correct
3. Ensure your source database is accessible
