`@upstash/search` is a TypeScript SDK for Upstash AI Search.

Using `@upstash/search` you can:

- Perform AI-powered search queries
- Upsert documents to an index
- Fetch documents by their IDs
- Delete documents from a database
- Access database stats
- Reset databases

You can find the GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/search-js).

## Usage

### Initializing the client

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash search client: 
- a REST token
- a REST URL

 These values can be passed using environment variables or through a configuration object. Find these connection details in [the console dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/search).

 ---

#### Using environment variables (recommended)

You can follow [this guide](/search/overall/getstarted) to retrieve the following credentials.

```bash
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

When these environment variables are set, the client constructor does not require any additional arguments.

```typescript
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";

const client = Search.fromEnv();
const index = client.index("movies")
```

---

#### Using a configuration object

The `Search` class accepts a config object containing the `url` and `token` values. This
could be useful if your application needs to interact with multiple databases, each with a different configuration.

```typescript
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";

const client = new Search({
  url: "<SEARCH_INDEX_REST_URL>",
  token: "<SEARCH_INDEX_REST_TOKEN>",
});

const index = client.index("movies")
```

---

#### Typescript

The Search SDK supports defining your content and metadata types at the index level for complete type-safety.

```typescript {4,5,6}
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";
const client = new Search();

type Content = { title: string, genre: string };
type Metadata = { year: number };
const index = client.index<Content, Metadata>("movies");

await index.upsert({
  id: "document-id",
  content: { title: "Star Wars", genre: "sci-fi" },
  metadata: { year: 1977 }
})
```

Passing a `Content` type at the index level will provide type safety for the content coming back from or required for the following commands:
- `search`
- `upsert`
- `fetch`
- `range`

#### Typesafe Filtering

When you provide type definitions for your content and metadata, you can use typesafe filters in your search queries:

```typescript
// Basic search with typesafe filter
const results = await index.search({
  query: "science fiction movies",
  filter: {
    genre: { $eq: "sci-fi" },
    "@metadata.year": { $gte: 1980 }
  }
});

// Fuzzy search with typo tolerance
const fuzzyResults = await index.search({
  query: "star wars",
  filter: {
    title: { $fuzzy: { value: "Star Warrs", distance: 2 } }
  }
});

// Fuzzy search with prefix matching
const prefixResults = await index.search({
  query: "movies",
  filter: {
    title: { $fuzzy: { value: "star", distance: 1, prefix: true } }
  }
});
```

In cases you don't want to define a content type at the index level, you can override the index level type definition for a specific command:

```typescript
const results = await index.upsert<Content>({
  id: "id",
  content: { title: "Movie title", ... }
});
```

## Telemetry

This sdk sends anonymous telemetry data to help us improve your experience.
We collect the following:

- SDK version
- Platform (Cloudflare, AWS or Vercel)
- Runtime version (node@18.x)

You can opt out by setting the `UPSTASH_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable
to any truthy value.

```sh
UPSTASH_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

Alternatively, you can disable telemetry programmatically:

```ts
const index = client.index("movies", {
  enableTelemetry: false,
});
```
