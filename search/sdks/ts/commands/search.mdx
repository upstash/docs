The search method is designed to retrieve the most relevant documents from the database, using AI-powered search capabilities. This method supports a variety of options to configure the query to your needs.

For more details on how the search algorithm works, please refer to our [advanced settings documentation](/search/features/advanced-settings).

<Note>
  The score returned from search requests is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest relevance and 0 the lowest.
