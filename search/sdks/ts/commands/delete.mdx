The delete method allows you to delete documents from your index using various criteria. You can delete documents by their IDs, by ID prefix or with metadata filter.

## Arguments

  One or more document IDs to delete.
</ResponseField>

**OR**

<ResponseField name="DeletePayload" type="object" required>
  <Expandable defaultOpen="true">

    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="prefix" type="string">
      A string prefix to match document IDs for deletion. All documents with IDs starting with this prefix will be deleted.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="filter" type="string">

      <Warning>
        Deleting document with filter is a O(N) operation that performs a full
        scan. Therefore, it might be slow for large indexes.
