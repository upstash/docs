## 1. Installation

```bash
npm install @upstash/search-ui
```

```typescript
// 👇 import package and optimized styles
import { SearchBar } from "@upstash/search-ui"
import "@upstash/search-ui/dist/index.css"
```

---

## 2. Code Example

Our search component is designed to be **provider agnostic**.

In the code below we're using [Upstash Search](../overall//getstarted.mdx) - our solution for fast, reliable and highly scalable serverless search.

Creating a search database takes less than a minute: [get started here](../overall//getstarted.mdx). To follow along with Upstash Search, install the package:

```bash
npm install @upstash/search
```

```tsx
"use client"

import { SearchBar } from "@upstash/search-ui"
import "@upstash/search-ui/dist/index.css"

import { Search } from "@upstash/search"
import { FileText } from "lucide-react"

const client = new Search({
  url: "<UPSTASH_SEARCH_URL>",
  token: "<YOUR_SEARCH_READONLY_TOKEN>",
})

const index = client.index<{ title: string }>("movies")

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm mt-24 mx-auto">
      <SearchBar.Dialog>
        <SearchBar.DialogTrigger placeholder="Search movies..." />

        <SearchBar.DialogContent>
          <SearchBar.Input placeholder="Type to search movies..." />
          <SearchBar.Results
            searchFn={(query) => {
              // 👇 100% type-safe: whatever you return here is
              // automatically typed as `result` below
              return index.search({ query, limit: 10, reranking: true })
            }}
          >
            {(result) => (
              <SearchBar.Result value={result.id} key={result.id}>
                <SearchBar.ResultIcon>
                  <FileText className="text-gray-600" />
                </SearchBar.ResultIcon>

                <SearchBar.ResultContent>
                  <SearchBar.ResultTitle>
                    {result.content.title}
                  </SearchBar.ResultTitle>
                  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-0.5">Movie</p>
                </SearchBar.ResultContent>
              </SearchBar.Result>
            )}
          </SearchBar.Results>
        </SearchBar.DialogContent>
      </SearchBar.Dialog>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Using a Readonly Token (recommended)

The token used in the `Search` client above is a read-only token.

<Frame><img src='/img/search/readonly_token.png' /></Frame>

This token is safe to expose on the frontend. This allows your application to perform search queries without the need for a backend API.

To use environment variables for the token, set it as `NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUR_READONLY_TOKEN` in your `.env` file.

Optionally, you can also create a separate backend API to handle search on the server.

---

## Handling Results

You can perform actions with the search results by using the `onSelect` prop on `SearchBar.Item`:

```tsx
<SearchBar.Result
  onSelect={() => {
    // 👇 do something with result
    console.log(result)
  }}
  value={result.id}
  key={result.id}
>
```

## Customization

This component is beautifully pre-styled, but 100% customizable. You can change every piece of it yourself by passing normal React props to each component (such as `className`).

**For example**: If you wanted to change the primary color, change the CSS classes:

```tsx
<SearchBar.Input
  className="focus:ring-red-500"
  placeholder="Type to search movies..."
/>

<SearchBar.ResultTitle
  className="font-medium text-gray-900"
  highlightClassName="decoration-red-500 text-red-500"
>
  {result.content.title}
</SearchBar.ResultTitle>
```

This component is based on the [Radix UI Dialog Primitive](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog) and Paco Coursey's [cmdk](https://cmdk.paco.me/) library.
