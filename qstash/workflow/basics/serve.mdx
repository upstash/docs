title: "Serve Method"
---

Use the `serve` method to define an endpoint that serves a workflow. It provides a context object that you use to create all of your workflow's steps.

For example, in a Next.js app:

```typescript
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs"

export const POST = serve<string>(async (context) => {
  // 👇 typed as string
  const input = context.requestPayload

  // 👇 define a piece of business logic as step 1
  const result = await context.run("step-1", async () => {
    // ...
  })

  // 👇 define another piece of business logic as step 2
  await context.run("step-2", async () => {
    // ...
  })
})
```

## Platform support

Besides Next.js, the `serve` method supports multiple frameworks and platforms. See [all supported platforms](/qstash/workflow/quickstarts/platforms) here.

## Options

### `failureUrl`

Use the `failureUrl` option to specify a URL your workflow will call if it exhausted all retries and fails.

```typescript
export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    failureUrl: "https://<YOUR-FAILURE-ENDPOINT>/..."
  }
);
```

If specified, this URL will be called with [the failure callback payload](qstash/features/callbacks#what-is-a-failure-callback), and the error message will be included in the `body` field.

The default value is `undefined`, meaning no failure URL is called.

### `failureFunction`

Use the `failureFunction` to define a function that's executed when your workflow exhausts all its [retries](/qstash/features/retry) and fails.

```typescript
export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    failureFunction: async (
      context,      // context during failure
      failStatus,   // failure status
      failResponse, // failure message
      failHeaders   // failure headers
    ) => {
      // handle the failure
    }
  }
);
```

If both `failureUrl` and `failureFunction` are provided, the failure function takes precedence and the value of `failureUrl` is ignored.

Note that if you are using a [custom authorization method](/qstash/workflow/howto/security#custom-authorization-method), you should also add authentication to `failureFunction`.

By default, `failureFunction` is `undefined`, meaning that no function is executed on failure.

### `verbose`

To gain insights into how the workflow operates, you can enable verbose mode:

```typescript
export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    verbose: true
  }
);
```

Each log entry has the following structure:

```
{
  timestamp: number,
  workflowRunId: string,
  logLevel: string,
  eventType: string,
  details: unknown,
}
```

The `eventType` can be:

- `ENDPOINT_START` each time the workflow endpoint is called
- `RUN_SINGLE` or `RUN_PARALLEL` when step(s) are executed
- `SUBMIT_STEP` when a single step is executed
- `SUBMIT_FIRST_INVOCATION` when a new workflow run starts
- `SUBMIT_CLEANUP` when a workflow run finishes
- `SUBMIT_THIRD_PARTY_RESULT` when a third-party call result is received (see `context.call`)

Verbose mode is disabled by default.

### `initialPayloadParser`

When calling the workflow endpoint to start a workflow run, your initial request's payload is expected to be either empty, a string, or JSON.

If your payload differs, you can process it as needed using the `initialPayloadParser` option:

```typescript
type InitialPayload = {
  foo: string
  bar: number
}

// 👇 1: provide initial payload type
export const POST = serve<InitialPayload>(
  async (context) => {
    // 👇 3: parsing result is available as requestPayload
    const payload: InitialPayload = context.requestPayload
  },
  {
    // 👇 2: custom parsing for initial payload
    initialPayloadParser: (initialPayload) => {
      const payload: InitialPayload =
        parsePayload(initialPayload)
      return payload
    },
  }
)
```

### `url`

Since a workflow run involves multiple calls to the workflow endpoint, the `serve` method needs to know where your endpoint is hosted.

Typically, your workflow infers this using the `request.url` field.

However, if you use a proxy or a local tunnel for development, you may want to override the URL inferred from `request.url`:

```typescript
export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    url: "https://<YOUR-DEPLOYED-APP>.com/api/workflow"
  }
);
```

By default, `url` is `undefined`, and the URL is inferred from `request.url`.

### `baseUrl`

An alternative to the `url` option is the `baseUrl` option. While `url` replaces the entire URL inferred from `request.url`, `baseUrl` only changes the base of the URL:

```typescript
export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    ...
  },
  // options:
  {
    baseUrl: "<LOCAL-TUNNEL-PUBLIC-URL>"
  }
);
```

The default value of `baseUrl` is `undefined`.

If you have multiple endpoints and you don't want to set `baseUrl` in every single one, you can set the `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` environment variable to apply `baseUrl` across your entire application.

Setting this environment variable is especially useful during [local development](/qstash/workflow/howto/local-development). In production, `baseUrl` or `UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL` are not necessary.

## Further options

The following options can be considered convenience methods. They are intended to support edge cases or testing pipelines and are **not required for regular use**.

### `qstashClient`

The `qstashClient` option allows you to pass a QStash Client explicitly. This can be helpful when using multiple QStash clients in the same project with different environment variables.

```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";

export const POST = serve(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    qstashClient: new Client({ token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN })
  }
);
```

By default, a `qstashClient` is initialized as:

```typescript
new Client({
  baseUrl: process.env.QSTASH_URL!,
  token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN!,
})
```

### `receiver`

You can pass a QStash Receiver to verify that **every** request the endpoint receives comes from QStash, preventing anyone from triggering your workflow.

```typescript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";

export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    receiver: new Receiver({
      // 👇 grab these variables from your QStash dashboard
      currentSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY!,
      nextSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY!,
    })
  }
);
```

The default receiver is automatically used if the environment variables `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` are set. If you want to turn off the Receiver, remove these environment variables or pass `receiver: undefined` in the options. Note that this will skip any verification that requests are coming from QStash and allow anyone to start your workflow.

### `env`

By default, the SDK uses `process.env` to initialize the QStash client and the receiver (if the two environment variables are set). If `process.env` doesn't exist, the SDK won't be able to access the environment variables. In this case, you can either pass `qstashClient` and `receiver` options or use the `env` option.

If you pass `env`, this `env` will be used instead of `process.env`:

```typescript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";

export const POST = serve<string>(
  async (context) => {
    // the env option will be available in the env field of the context:
    const env = context.env;
  },
  {
    receiver: new Receiver({
      // 👇 grab these variables from your QStash dashboard
      currentSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY!,
      nextSigningKey: process.env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY!,
    })
  }
);
```
