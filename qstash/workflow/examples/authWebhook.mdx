title: "Auth Provider Webhook"
---

This example demonstrates an authentication provider webhook process using Upstash Workflow. 
The workflow handles the user creation, trial management, email reminders and notifications.

## Use Case

Our workflow will:

1. Receive a webhook event from an authentication provider (e.g. Firebase, Auth0, Clerk etc.)
2. Create a new user in our database
3. Create a new user in Stripe
4. Start a trial in Stripe
5. Send a welcome email
6. Send a reminder email if the user hasn't solved any questions in the last 7 days
7. Send a trial warning email if the user hasn't upgraded 2 days before the trial ends
8. Send a trial ended email if the user hasn't upgraded

## Code Example

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { WorkflowContext } from '@upstash/qstash/workflow'

/**
 * This can be the payload of the user created webhook event coming from your
 * auth provider (e.g. Firebase, Auth0, Clerk etc.)
 */
type UserCreatedPayload = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

export const { POST } = serve<UserCreatedPayload>(async (context) => {
  const { name, email } = context.requestPayload;

  const { userid } = await context.run("sync user", async () => {
    return await createUserInDatabase({ name, email });
  });

  await context.run("create new user in stripe", async () => {
    await createNewUserInStripe(email);
  });

  await context.run("start trial in Stripe", async () => {
    await startTrialInStripe(email);
  });

  await context.run("send welcome email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(
      email,
      "Welcome to our platform!, You have 14 days of free trial."
    );
  });

  await context.sleep("wait", 7 * 24 * 60 * 60);

  // get user stats and send email with them
  const stats = await context.run("get user stats", async () => {
    return await getUserStats(userid);
  });
  await sendProblemSolvedEmail({context, email, stats});

  // wait until there are two days to the end of trial period
  // and check upgrade status
  await context.sleep("wait for trial warning", 5 * 24 * 60 * 60);
  const isUpgraded = await context.run("check upgraded plan", async () => {
    return await checkUpgradedPlan(email);
  });

  // end the workflow if upgraded
  if (isUpgraded) return;

  await context.run("send trial warning email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(
      email,
      "Your trial is about to end in 2 days. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform."
    );
  });

  await context.sleep("wait for trial end", 2 * 24 * 60 * 60);

  await context.run("send trial end email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(
      email,
      "Your trial has ended. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform."
    );
  });
});

async function sendProblemSolvedEmail({
  context: WorkflowContext<UserCreatedPayload>
  email: string,
  stats: { totalProblemsSolved: number }
}) {
  if (stats.totalProblemsSolved === 0) {
    await context.run("send no answers email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(
        email,
        "Hey, you haven't solved any questions in the last 7 days..."
      );
    });
  } else {
    await context.run("send stats email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(
        email,
        `You have solved ${stats.totalProblemsSolved} problems in the last 7 days. Keep it up!`
      );
    });
  }
}

async function createUserInDatabase({
  name,
  email,
}: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}) {
  console.log("Creating a user in the database:", name, email);
  return { userid: "12345" };
}

async function createNewUserInStripe(email: string) {
  // Implement logic to create a new user in Stripe
  console.log("Creating a user in Stripe for", email);
}

async function startTrialInStripe(email: string) {
  // Implement logic to start a trial in Stripe
  console.log("Starting a trial of 14 days in Stripe for", email);
}

async function getUserStats(userid: string) {
  // Implement logic to get user stats
  console.log("Getting user stats for", userid);
  return {
    totalProblemsSolved: 10_000,
    mostInterestedTopic: "JavaScript",
  };
}

async function checkUpgradedPlan(email: string) {
  // Implement logic to check if the user has upgraded the plan
  console.log("Checking if the user has upgraded the plan", email);
  return false;
}

async function sendEmail(email: string, content: string) {
  // Implement logic to send an email
  console.log("Sending email to", email, content);
}
```

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Sync User

We start by creating a new user in our database:

```typescript 
const { userid } = await context.run("sync user", async () => {
  return await createUserInDatabase({ name, email });
});
```

### 2. Create New User in Stripe

Next, we create a new user in Stripe:

```typescript 
await context.run("create new user in stripe", async () => {
  await createNewUserInStripe(email);
});
```

### 3. Start Trial in Stripe

We start a trial in Stripe:

```typescript 
await context.run("start trial in Stripe", async () => {
  await startTrialInStripe(email);
});
```

### 4. Send Welcome Email

We send a welcome email to the user:

```typescript 
await context.run("send welcome email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    email,
    "Welcome to our platform!, You have 14 days of free trial."
  );
});
```

### 5. Send Reminder Email

After 7 days, we check if the user has solved any questions. If not, we send a reminder email:

```typescript 
await context.sleep("wait", 7 * 24 * 60 * 60);

const stats = await context.run("get user stats", async () => {
  return await getUserStats(userid);
});
await sendProblemSolvedEmail({context, email, stats});
```

The `sendProblemSolvedEmail` method:

```typescript
async function sendProblemSolvedEmail({
  context: WorkflowContext<UserCreatedPayload>
  email: string,
  stats: { totalProblemsSolved: number }
}) {
  if (stats.totalProblemsSolved === 0) {
    await context.run("send no answers email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(
        email,
        "Hey, you haven't solved any questions in the last 7 days..."
      );
    });
  } else {
    await context.run("send stats email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(
        email,
        `You have solved ${stats.totalProblemsSolved} problems in the last 7 days. Keep it up!`
      );
    });
  }
}
```

### 6. Send Trial Warning Email

If the user hasn't upgraded 2 days before the trial ends, we send a trial warning email:

```typescript 
await context.sleep("wait for trial warning", 5 * 24 * 60 * 60);

const isUpgraded = await context.run("check upgraded plan", async () => {
  return await checkUpgradedPlan(email);
});

if (isUpgraded) return;

await context.run("send trial warning email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    email,
    "Your trial is about to end in 2 days. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform."
  );
});
```

If they upgraded, we end the workflow by returning.

### 7. Send Trial Ended Email

If the user hasn't upgraded after the trial ends, we send a trial ended email:

```typescript 
await context.sleep("wait for trial end", 2 * 24 * 60 * 60);

await context.run("send trial end email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    email,
    "Your trial has ended. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform."
  );
});
```
