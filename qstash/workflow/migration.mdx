title: "Migration to New SDK"
---

On October 18, 2024, we released a new SDK `@upstash/workflow` for Upstash Workflow and decided to separate Workflow development from the QStash SDK. While Upstash Workflow is built upon QStash, our goal is to enhance the developer experience and support by having a dedicated SDK.
Upstash Workflow development will take place in `@upstash/workflow`. and Workflow related imports will be removed from `@upstash/qstash` in future releases.

If you had started using Upstash Workflow with `@upstash/qstash`, you will
need to migrate to `@upstash/workflow`. We have made some backwards incompatible changes but we
want to make the transition as smooth as possible.

In this guide, we will explain the changes you may need to make for migration.

### Install `@upstash/workflow`

First, we will need to install the new package with:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @upstash/workflow
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


If you were using `@upstash/qstash` only for workflow, you can uninstall it from your project.

### Serve methods

You will need to change the imports from `@upstash/qstash` to @upstash/workflow:

```ts
// old
import { serve } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs"

// new 
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs"
```

We have updated what our `serve` methods return. We made this change to make it
easier to extend the API in the future.

For instance, Next.js method changed like this:

```javascript
// old
export const POST = serve(...);

// new
export const { POST } = serve(...);
```

We kept the `serve` method of `Hono` the same. The rest are updated in a similar way.
See [the quickstarts](/qstash/workflow/quickstarts/platforms) for the new way `serve`
should be used.

Additionally, `@upstash/workflow/nuxt` import is removed. You should use `@upstash/workflow/h3`
instead. This change was made because `nuxt` uses `h3` under the hood and our `serve` method
for `nuxt` can work with any project using `h3`.

### Updating `context.call`

If you were using [`context.call` method](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-call) in your workflow, you will need to change
how it's called and what it returns. Here is what the change looks like:

```javascript
// old
const result = await context.call("call step", "<call-url>", "POST", ...)

// new
const {
  status,  // response status
  headers, // response headers
  body     // response body
} = await context.call("call step", {
  url: "<call-url>",
  method: "POST",
  ...
})
```

In the old version, we only returned the response body. Also, if the request
to the url failed, [the workflow run would fail](/qstash/workflow/howto/failures).

In the new version, we update how the parameters are passed to the `context.call`.
Additionally, we change the fail behavior: if the request fails, it doesn't make the
workflow fail. Instead, the status and the body is simply returned and workflow
continues as usual.

If you have ongoing workflow runs which call `context.call` during your transition,
`status` and `headers` fields may not be available in these old runs. After your
transition, all workflow runs will have all three fields.
