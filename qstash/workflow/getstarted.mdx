## Overview

Upstash Workflow lets you write **durable, reliable and performant serverless functions**. Get delivery guarantees, automatic retries on failure, scheduling and more without managing any infrastructure.

- **No more function timeouts** on serverless platforms
- **Automatic error recovery**, continue a workflow run from any step
- Integrates perfectly with your existing infrastructure; all code runs on your servers
- **Delivery guarantees**, batching, schedules and more

On October 18, 2024 we released a new sdk `@upstash/workflow` for Upstash Workflow.
If you were using `@upstash/qstash` for Upstash Workflow, you can use [the migration
guide](/qstash/workflow/migration) for the transition.

## Quickstarts

Workflow supports Next.js, Cloudflare Workers and [many more frameworks](/qstash/workflow/quickstarts/platforms).

    Download a large dataset without timeouts, process the data in chunks and generate a report.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authorization Webhook" icon="webhook" href="/qstash/workflow/examples/authWebhook">
    Start a workflow from a webhook. Handle user creation, trial management, email reminders and notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customer Onboarding" icon="user" href="/qstash/workflow/examples/customerOnboarding">
    Register a new user, send welcome emails, and periodically check and respond to the user's activity state with emails.
  </Card>
  <Card title="E-Commerce Order Fulfillment" icon="cart-flatbed-boxes" href="/qstash/workflow/examples/eCommerceOrderFulfillment">
    Receive an order request, verify the stock, process the payment, and handle order dispatch and customer notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Image Processing" icon="image" href="/qstash/workflow/examples/imageProcessing">
    Manage uploading images to the data store. Apply filters and resize the images to different resolutions in parallel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Retry Payments" icon="credit-card" href="/qstash/workflow/examples/paymentRetry">
    Retry payments with a day of delay, send emails, and suspend account if payment fails after the retries.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it works

Upstash Workflow builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, _each step_ can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.

## Next.js code example

Let's see a practical implementation of Upstash Workflow using Next.js and customer onboarding as an example. See our [Next.js Quickstart](/qstash/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs) for a complete guide.

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { sendEmail } from "./emailUtils";

// Type-safety for starting our workflow
interface InitialData {
  userId: string
  email: string
  name: string
}

export const POST = serve<InitialData>(async (context) => {
  const { userId, email, name } = context.requestPayload;

  // Step 1: Send welcome email
  await context.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(email, "Welcome to our service!");
  });

  // Step 2: Wait for 3 days (in seconds)
  await context.sleep("sleep-until-follow-up", 60 * 60 * 24 * 3);

  // Step 3: AI-generate personalized follow-up message
  const aiResponse = await context.call(
    "generate-personalized-message",
    "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    "POST",
    {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are an assistant creating personalized follow-up messages." },
        { role: "user", content: `Create a short, friendly follow-up message for ${name} who joined our service 3 days ago.` }
      ]
    },
    { headers: { ... } }
  );

  const personalizedMessage = aiResponse.choices[0].message.content;

  // Step 4: Send personalized follow-up email
  await context.run("send-follow-up-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(email, personalizedMessage);
  });
});
```

<Tip>
  Any HTTP request using `context.call`, like the AI-generation above, does not
  count towards your function's execution time and does not increase your
  serverless bill. It can also run for up to 2 hours, completely bypassing any
  platform-specific function timeouts.
</Tip>

The above example should give you a rough idea of how a workflow looks in code. For step-by-step instructions on setting up your first workflow with images along the way, see our [Next.js Quickstart](/qstash/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs).

Here are more details about what the `context` object does:

- [context.run](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-run)
- [context.sleep](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-sleep)
- [context.sleepUntil](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-sleepuntil)
- [context.call](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-call)
- [context.waitForEvent](/qstash/workflow/basics/context#context-waitforevent)
