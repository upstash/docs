QStash is a **serverless messaging and scheduling solution**. It fits easily into your existing workflow and allows you to build reliable systems without managing infrastructure.

Instead of calling an endpoint directly, QStash acts as a middleman between you and an API to guarantee delivery, perform automatic retries on failure, and more.

## Send your first message

<Check>
**Prerequisite**

You need an Upstash account before publishing messages, create one
[here](https://console.upstash.com).

</Check>

### Public API

Make sure you have a publicly available HTTP API that you want to send your
messages to. If you don't, you can use something like
[requestcatcher.com](https://requestcatcher.com/), [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) or
[webhook-test.com](https://webhook-test.com/) to try it out.

For example, you can use this URL to test your messages: [https://firstqstashmessage.requestcatcher.com](https://firstqstashmessage.requestcatcher.com)

### Get your token

Go to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the
`QSTASH_TOKEN`.

### Publish a message

A message can be any shape or form: json, xml, binary, anything, that can be
transmitted in the http request body. We do not impose any restrictions other
than a size limit of 1 MB (which can be customized at your request).

In addition to the request body itself, you can also send HTTP headers. Learn
more about this in the [message publishing section](/qstash/howto/publishing).

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://<your-api-url>'
```

```bash cURL RequestCatcher
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://firstqstashmessage.requestcatcher.com/test'
```

</CodeGroup>

Don't worry, we have SDKs for different languages so you don't
have to make these requests manually.

### Check Response

You should receive a response with a unique message ID.
