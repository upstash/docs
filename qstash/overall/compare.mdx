In this section, we will compare QStash with alternative solutions.

TODO we can now mention Inngest,Trigger.Dev / Restate etc....

### BullMQ

BullMQ is a message queue for NodeJS based on Redis. BullMQ is open source
project, you can run BullMQ yourself.

- Using BullMQ in serverless environments is problematic due to stateless nature
  of serverless. QStash is designed for serverless environments.

- With BullMQ, you need to run a stateful application to consume messages.
  QStash calls the API endpoints, so you do not need your application to consume
  messages continuously.

- You need to run and maintain BullMQ and Redis yourself. QStash is completely
  serverless, you maintain nothing and pay for just what you use.

### Zeplo

Zeplo is a message queue targeting serverless. Just like QStash it allows users
to queue and schedule HTTP requests.

While Zeplo targets serverless, it has a fixed monthly price in paid plans which
is \$39/month. In QStash, price scales to zero, you do not pay if you are not
using it.

With Zeplo, you can send messages to a single endpoint. With QStash, in addition
to endpoint, you can submit messages to a URL Group which groups one or more
endpoints into a single namespace. Zeplo does not have URL Group functionality.

### Quirrel

Quirrel is a job queueing service for serverless. It has a similar functionality
with QStash.

Quirrel is acquired by Netlify, some of its functionality is available as
Netlify scheduled functions. QStash is platform independent, you can use it
anywhere.
