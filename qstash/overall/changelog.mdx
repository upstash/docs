</Update>

<Update label="April 2025">
- **QStash Server:** 
    - Added support for `flow-control period`, allowing users to define a period for a given rate—up to 1 week.  
      Previously, the period was fixed at 1 second.  
      For example, `rate: 3 period: 1d` means publishes will be throttled to 3 per day.
    - Applied several performance optimizations.
- **Console:**
    - Added `IN_PROGRESS` as a filter option when grouping by message ID, making it easier to query in-flight messages.  
      See [here](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/howto/debug-logs#lifecycle-of-a-message) for an explanation of message states.
</Update>

<Update label="March 2025">
- **TypeScript SDK (`qstash-js`):**

    - For all fixes, see the full changelog [here](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js/compare/v2.7.22...v2.7.23).

</Update>  

<Update label="November 2024">
- **TypeScript SDK (qstash-js):**
    - Added support for the Anthropics provider and refactored the `api` field of `publishJSON`. See the documentation [here](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/integrations/anthropic).

    - Validated the scheduleId parameter. The scheduleId must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods.
    - Added filtering support to bulk message cancellation. Users can now delete messages matching specific filters. See Rest API [here](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/api/messages/bulk-cancel).

<Update label="October 2024">
- **TypeScript SDK (qstash-js):**
    - Fixed a bug on qstash-js where we skipped using the next signing key when the current signing key fails to verify the `upstash-signature`. Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
    - Added resend API. See [here](/qstash/integrations/resend). Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
    - Added `schedule to queues` feature to the qstash-js. See [here](/qstash/features/schedules#scheduling-to-a-queue). Released with qstash-js v2.7.14.
- **Console:**
    - Optimized the console by trimming event bodies, reducing resource usage and enabling efficient querying of events with large payloads.
- **Qstash Server:**
    - Began development on a new architecture to deliver faster event processing on the server.
    - Added more fields to events in the [REST API](/qstash/api/events/list), including `Timeout`, `Method`, `Callback`, `CallbackHeaders`, `FailureCallback`, `FailureCallbackHeaders`, and `MaxRetries`.
    - Enhanced retry backoff logic by supporting additional headers for retry timing. Along with `Retry-After`, Qstash now recognizes `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset-Tokens` as backoff time indicators. See [here](/qstash/features/retry#retry-after-headers) for more details.
</Update>

<Update label="September 2024">
- Improved performance, resulting in reduced latency for average publish times.
- Set the `nbf` (not before) claim on Signing Keys to 0. This claim specifies the time before which the JWT must not be processed. Previously, this was incorrectly used, causing validation issues when there were minor clock discrepancies between systems.
- Fixed queue name validation. Queue names must now be alphanumeric or include hyphens, underscores, or periods, consistent with other API resources.
- Resolved bugs related to [overwriting a schedule](/qstash/features/schedules#overwriting-an-existing-schedule).
