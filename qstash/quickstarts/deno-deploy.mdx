[Source Code](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-examples/tree/main/deno-deploy)

This is a step by step guide on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your Deno
deploy project.

### 1. Create a new project

Go to [https://dash.deno.com/projects](https://dash.deno.com/projects) and
create a new playground project.

### 2. Edit the handler function

Then paste the following code into the browser editor:

```ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.142.0/http/server.ts";
import { Receiver } from "https://deno.land/x/upstash_qstash@v0.1.4/mod.ts";

serve(async (req: Request) => {
  const r = new Receiver({
    currentSigningKey: Deno.env.get("QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY")!,
    nextSigningKey: Deno.env.get("QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY")!,
  });

  const isValid = await r.verify({
    signature: req.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
    body: await req.text(),
  }).catch((err: Error) => {
    console.error(err);
    return false;
  });

  if (!isValid) {
    return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 });
  }

  console.log("The signature was valid");

  // do work

  return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
});
```

### 3. Add your signing keys

Click on the `settings` button at the top of the screen and then click
`+ Add Variable`

Get your current and next signing key from
[Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and then set them in deno deploy.

### 4. Deploy

Simply click on `Save & Deploy` at the top of the screen.

### 5. Publish a message

Make note of the url displayed in the top right. This is the public url of your
project.

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://early-frog-33.deno.dev" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

In the logs you should see something like this:

```basheurope-west3isolate start time: 2.21 ms
Listening on http://localhost:8000/
The signature was valid
```

## Next Steps

That's it, you have successfully created a secure deno API, that receives and
verifies incoming webhooks from qstash.
