title: "Cloudflare Workers"

This is a step by step guide on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your
Cloudflare Worker.

### Project Setup

We will use **C3 (create-cloudflare-cli)** command-line tool to create our functions. You can open a new terminal window and run C3 using the prompt below.

<CodeGroup>

```shell npm
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

```shell yarn
yarn create cloudflare@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

This will install the `create-cloudflare` package, and lead you through setup. C3 will also install Wrangler in projects by default, which helps us testing and deploying the projects.

```text
➜  npm create cloudflare@latest
Need to install the following packages:
  create-cloudflare@2.1.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y

using create-cloudflare version 2.1.0

```

We will also install the **Upstash QStash library**.

```bash
npm install @upstash/qstash
```

### 3. Use QStash in your handler

First we import the library:

```ts src/index.ts
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash"
```

Then we adjust the `Env` interface to include the `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`
and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` environment variables.

```ts src/index.ts
export interface Env {
  QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY: string
  QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY: string
}
```

And then we validate the signature in the `handler` function.

First we create a new receiver and provide it with the signing keys.

```ts src/index.ts
const receiver = new Receiver({
  currentSigningKey: env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY,
  nextSigningKey: env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY,
})
```

Then we verify the signature.

```ts src/index.ts
const body = await request.text()

const isValid = await receiver.verify({
  signature: request.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
  body,
})
```

The entire file looks like this now:

```ts src/index.ts
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash"
export interface Env {
  QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY: string
  QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY: string
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    const c = new Receiver({
      currentSigningKey: env.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY,
      nextSigningKey: env.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY,
    })

    const body = await request.text()

    const isValid = await c
      .verify({
        signature: request.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
        body,
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err)
        return false
      })

    if (!isValid) {
      return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 })
    }

    // signature is valid

    return new Response("Hello World!")
  },
}
```

### Configure Credentials

There are two methods for setting up the credentials for QStash. The recommended way is to use Cloudflare Upstash Integration. Alternatively, you can add the credentials manually.

#### Using the Cloudflare Integration

Access to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and login with the same account that you've used while setting up the Worker application. Then, navigate to **Workers & Pages > Overview** section on the sidebar. Here, you'll find your application listed.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/cloudflare-integration/overview.png" />
</Frame>

Clicking on the application will direct you to the application details page, where you can perform the integration process. Switch to the **Settings** tab in the application details, and proceed to **Integrations** section. You will see various Worker integrations listed. To proceed, click the **Add Integration** button associated with the QStash.

  <img src="/img/cloudflare-integration/qstash-add-integration.png" />
</Frame>

On the Integration page, connect to your Upstash account. Then, select the related database from the dropdown menu. Finalize the process by pressing Save button.

#### Setting up Manually

Navigate to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) and copy/paste your QStash credentials to `wrangler.toml` as below.

```yaml
[vars]
QSTASH_URL="REPLACE_HERE"
QSTASH_TOKEN="REPLACE_HERE"
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="REPLACE_HERE"
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="REPLACE_HERE"
```

### Test and Deploy

You can test the function locally with `npx wrangler dev`

Deploy your function to Cloudflare with `npx wrangler deploy`

The endpoint of the function will be provided to you, once the deployment is done.

### Publish a message

Open a different terminal and publish a message to QStash. Note the destination
url is the same that was printed in the previous deploy step.

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://cloudflare-workers.upstash.workers.dev" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

In the logs you should see something like this:

```bash
$ npx wrangler tail

⛅️ wrangler 2.0.17
--------------------
Retrieving cached values for account from node_modules/.cache/wrangler
Successfully created tail, expires at 2022-07-11T21:11:36Z
Connected to cloudflare-workers, waiting for logs...
POST https://cloudflare-workers.upstash.workers.dev/ - Ok @ 7/11/2022, 5:13:19 PM
  (log) The signature was valid
```

## Next Steps

That's it, you have successfully created a secure Cloudflare Worker, that
receives and verifies incoming webhooks from qstash.
