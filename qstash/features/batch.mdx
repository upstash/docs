title: "Batching"
---

[Publishing](/qstash/howto/publishing) is great for sending one message
at a time, but sometimes you want to send a batch of messages at once.

This can be useful to send messages to a single or multiple destinations.
QStash provides the `batch` endpoint to help
you with this.

If the format of the messages are valid, the response will be an array of
responses for each message in the batch. When batching URL Groups, the response
will be an array of responses for each destination in the URL Group. If one
message fails to be sent, that message will have an error response, but the
other messages will still be sent.

<Note>You can publish to destination, URL Group or queue in the same batch request.</Note>

## Batching messages with destinations

<Info>You can also send messages to the same destination!</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/batch \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '
     [
      {
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination1"
      },
      {
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination2"
      }
     ]'
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

// Each message is the same as the one you would send with the publish endpoint
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const res = await client.batchJSON([
  {
    url: "https://example.com/destination1",
  },
  {
    url: "https://example.com/destination2",
  },
]);
```

```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH-TOKEN>")
client.message.batch_json(
    [
        {"url": "https://example.com/destination1"},
        {"url": "https://example.com/destination2"},
    ]
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Batching messages with URL Groups

If you have a [URL Group](/qstash/howto/url-group-endpoint), you can batch send with
the URL Group as well.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/batch \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '
     [
      {
        "destination": "myUrlGroup"
      },
      {
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination2"
      }
     ]'
```

```typescript TypeScript
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

// Each message is the same as the one you would send with the publish endpoint
const res = await client.batchJSON([
  {
    urlGroup: "myUrlGroup",
  },
  {
    url: "https://example.com/destination2",
  },
]);
```

```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH-TOKEN>")
client.message.batch_json(
    [
        {"url_group": "my-url-group"},
        {"url": "https://example.com/destination2"},
    ]
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Batching messages with queue

If you have a [queue](/qstash/features/queues), you can batch send with
the queue. It is the same as publishing to a destination, but you need to set the queue name.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/batch \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '
     [
      {
        "queue": "my-queue",
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination1"
      },
      {
        "queue": "my-second-queue",
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination2"
      }
     ]'
```

```typescript TypeScript
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

const res = await client.batchJSON([
  {
    queueName: "my-queue",
    url: "https://example.com/destination1",
  },
  {
    queueName: "my-second-queue",
    url: "https://example.com/destination2",
  },
]);
```

```python Python
from upstash_qstash import QStash
from upstash_qstash.message import BatchRequest

qstash = QStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")

messages = [
    BatchRequest(
        queue="my-queue",
        url="https://httpstat.us/200",
        body=f"hi 1",
        retries=0
    ),
    BatchRequest(
        queue="my-second-queue",
        url="https://httpstat.us/200",
        body=f"hi 2",
        retries=0
    ),
]

qstash.message.batch(messages)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Batching messages with headers and body

You can provide custom headers and a body for each message in the batch.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/batch   -H "Authorization: Bearer XXX" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '
    [
      {
          "destination": "myUrlGroup",
          "headers":{
            "Upstash-Delay":"5s",
            "Upstash-Forward-Hello":"123456"
          },
          "body": "Hello World"
      },
      {
          "destination": "https://example.com/destination1",
          "headers":{
            "Upstash-Delay":"7s",
            "Upstash-Forward-Hello":"789"
          }
      },
      {
          "destination": "https://example.com/destination2",
          "headers":{
            "Upstash-Delay":"9s",
            "Upstash-Forward-Hello":"again"
          }
      }
    ]'
```

```typescript TypeScript
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

// Each message is the same as the one you would send with the publish endpoint
const msgs = [
  {
    urlGroup: "myUrlGroup",
    delay: 5,
    body: "Hello World",
    headers: {
      hello: "123456",
    },
  },
  {
    url: "https://example.com/destination1",
    delay: 7,
    headers: {
      hello: "789",
    },
  },
  {
    url: "https://example.com/destination2",
    delay: 9,
    headers: {
      hello: "again",
    },
    body: {
      Some: "Data",
    },
  },
];

const res = await client.batchJSON(msgs);
```

```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH-TOKEN>")
client.message.batch_json(
    [
        {
            "url_group": "my-url-group",
            "delay": "5s",
            "body": {"hello": "world"},
            "headers": {"random": "header"},
        },
        {
            "url": "https://example.com/destination1",
            "delay": "1m",
        },
        {
            "url": "https://example.com/destination2",
            "body": {"hello": "again"},
        },
    ]
)
```

</CodeGroup>

#### The response for this will look like

```json
[
  [
    {
      "messageId": "msg_...",
      "url": "https://myUrlGroup-endpoint1.com"
    },
    {
      "messageId": "msg_...",
      "url": "https://myUrlGroup-endpoint2.com"
    }
  ],
  {
    "messageId": "msg_..."
  },
  {
    "messageId": "msg_..."
  }
]
```
