title: "Schedules"
---

In addition to sending a message once, you can create a schedule, and we will
publish the message in the given period. To create a schedule, you simply need
to add the `Upstash-Cron` header to your `publish` request.

Schedules can be configured using `cron` expressions.
[crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) is a great tool for understanding and
creating cron expressions.

We use `UTC` as timezone when evaluating cron expressions.

The following request would create a schedule that will automatically publish
the message every minute:

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Upstash-Cron: * * * * *" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/schedules/https://example.com'
```
```typescript Typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const schedules = client.schedules();
await schedules.create({
  destination: "https://example.com",
  cron: "* * * * *",
});
```
```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
client.schedule.create(
    destination="https://example.com",
    cron="* * * * *",
)
```
</CodeGroup>

All of the [other config options](/qstash/howto/publishing#optional-parameters-and-configuration)
can still be used.

<Info>

It can take up to 60 seconds for the schedule to be loaded on an active node and
triggered for the first time.

</Info>

You can see and manage your schedules in the
[Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash).

### Scheduling to a URL Group

Instead of scheduling a message to a specific URL, you can also create a
schedule, that publishes to a URL Group. Simply use either the URL Group name or its id:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Upstash-Cron: * * * * *" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/schedules/<URL_GROUP_ID_OR_NAME>'
```
```typescript Typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const schedules = client.schedules();
await schedules.create({
  destination: "urlGroupName",
  cron: "* * * * *",
});
```
```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
client.schedule.create(
    destination="url-group-name",
    cron="* * * * *",
)
```
</CodeGroup>
