title: "Deduplication"
---

Messages can be deduplicated to prevent duplicate messages from being sent. When
a duplicate message is detected, it is accepted by QStash but not enqueued. This
can be useful when the connection between your service and QStash fails, and you
never receive the acknowledgement. You can simply retry publishing and can be
sure that the message will enqueued only once.

In case a message is a duplicate, we will accept the request and return the
messageID of the existing message. The only difference will be the response
status code. We'll send HTTP `202 Accepted` code in case of a duplicate message.

## Deduplication ID

To deduplicate a message, you can send the `Upstash-Deduplication-Id` header
when publishing the message.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Upstash-Deduplication-Id: abcdef" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://my-api..."'
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const res = await client.publishJSON({
  url: "https://my-api...",
  body: { hello: "world" },
  deduplicationId: "abcdef",
});
```

```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
client.message.publish_json(
    url="https://my-api...",
    body={
        "hello": "world",
    },
    deduplication_id="abcdef",
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Content Based Deduplication

If you want to deduplicate messages automatically, you can set the
`Upstash-Content-Based-Deduplication` header to `true`.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Upstash-Content-Based-Deduplication: true" \
    -d '{ "hello": "world" }' \
    'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/...'
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const res = await client.publishJSON({
  url: "https://my-api...",
  body: { hello: "world" },
  contentBasedDeduplication: true,
});
```

```python Python
from qstash import QStash

client = QStash("<QSTASH_TOKEN>")
client.message.publish_json(
    url="https://my-api...",
    body={
        "hello": "world",
    },
    content_based_deduplication=True,
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Content based deduplication creates a unique deduplication ID for the message
based on the following fields:

- **Destination**: The URL Group or endpoint you are publishing the message to.

- **Body**: The body of the message.

- **Header**: This includes the `Content-Type` header and all headers, that you
  forwarded with the `Upstash-Forward-` prefix. See
  [custom HTTP headers section](/qstash/howto/publishing#sending-custom-http-headers).

<Info>
The deduplication window is 10 minutes. After that, messages with the same ID or content can be sent again.
