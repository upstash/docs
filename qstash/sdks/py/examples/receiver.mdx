title: Receiver

When receiving a message from QStash, you should [verify the signature](/qstash/howto/signature).
The QStash Python SDK provides a helper function for this.

```python
from upstash_qstash import Receiver

receiver = Receiver({
  "current_signing_key": "YOUR_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY",
  "next_signing_key": "YOUR_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY",
})

# ... in your request handler

signature, body = req.headers["Upstash-Signature"], req.body

is_valid receiver.verify({
  "body": body,
  "signature": signature,
  "url": "YOUR-SITE-URL"
})
```
