#### Get all events with pagination using cursor

Since there can be a large number of events, they are paginated.
You can go through the results using the `cursor`.

```python
from upstash_qstash import Client

all_events = []
cursor = None
while True:
  res = client.events({"cursor": cursor})
  all_events.extend(res["events"])
  cursor = res.get("cursor")
  if cursor is None:
    break
```
