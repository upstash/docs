title: Receiver
---

When receiving a message from QStash, you should [verify the signature](/qstash/howto/signature).
The QStash Typescript SDK provides a helper function for this.

```typescript
import { Receiver } from "@upstash/qstash";

const receiver = new Receiver({
  currentSigningKey: "YOUR_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY",
  nextSigningKey: "YOUR_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY",
});

// ... in your request handler

const signature = req.headers["Upstash-Signature"];
const body = req.body;

const isValid = await receiver.verify({
  body,
  signature,
  url: "YOUR-SITE-URL",
});
```
