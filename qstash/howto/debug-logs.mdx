title: "Debug Logs"

To debug the logs, first you need to understand the different states a message can
be in.

Only the last 10.000 logs are kept and older logs are removed automatically.

## Lifecycle of a Message

To understand the lifecycle of each message, we'll look at the following chart:

Either you or a previously setup schedule will create a message.

When a message is ready for execution, it will be become `ACTIVE` and a delivery to
your API is attempted.

If you API responds with a status code between `200 - 299`, the task is
considered successful and will be marked as `DELIVERED`.

Otherwise the message is being retried if there are any retries left and moves to `RETRY`. If all retries are exhausted, the task has `FAILED` and the message will be moved to the DLQ.

During all this a message can be cancelled via [DELETE /v2/messages/:messageId](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/api/messages/cancel). When the request is received, `CANCEL_REQUESTED` will be logged first.
If retries are not exhausted yet, in the next deliver time, the message will be marked as `CANCELLED` and will be completely removed from the system.

## Console

Head over to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and go to
the `Logs` tab, where you can see the latest status of your messages.
