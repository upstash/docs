title: "Reset Token"

---

Your token is used to interact with the QStash API. You need it to publish
messages as well as create, read, update or delete other resources, such as
topics and endpoints.

Resetting your token will invalidate your current token and all future requests
with the old token will be rejected.

To reset your token, simply click on the "Reset token" button at the bottom in
the [QStash UI](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and confirm the dialog.

Afterwards you should immediately update your token in all your applications.
