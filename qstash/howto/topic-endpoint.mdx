QStash allows you to group multiple APIs together into a single namespace,
called a `topic`. Read more about topics [here](/qstash/features/topics).

There are two ways to create endpoints and topics: The UI and the REST API.

## UI

Go to [console.upstash.com/qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and click
on the `Topics` tab. Afterwards you can create a new topic by giving it a name.
Keep in mind that topic names are restricted to alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen
and dot characters.

After creating the topic, you can add endpoints to it:

## API

First you need to create a topic by providing a name:

```
curl -XPOST 'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/topics' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name": "my-topic"}'
```

And then you can create a new endpoint for this topic

```
curl -XPOST 'https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/endpoints' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"topicName": "my-topic", "url": "https://my-endpoint.com/path"}'
```
