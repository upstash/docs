title: "Roll Your Signing Keys"

---

Because your API needs to be publicly accessible from the internet, you should
make sure to verify the authenticity of each request.

Upstash provides a JWT with each request. This JWT is signed by your individual
secret signing keys. [Read more](/qstash/howto/signature).

We are using 2 signing keys:

- current: This is the key used to sign the JWT.
- next: This key will be used to sign after you have rolled your keys.

If we were using only a single key, there would be some time between when you
rolled your keys and when you can edit the key in your applications. In order to
minimize downtime, we use 2 keys and you should always try to verify with both
keys.

## What happens when I roll my keys?

When you roll your keys, the current key will be replaced with the next key and
a new next key will be generated.

```
currentKey = nextKey
nextKey = generateNewKey()
```

<Warning>

Rolling your keys twice without updating your applications will cause your apps
to reject all requests, because both the current and next keys will have been
replaced.
</Warning>

## How to roll your keys

Rolling your keys can be done by going to the
[QStash UI](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and clicking on the "Roll keys"
button.
