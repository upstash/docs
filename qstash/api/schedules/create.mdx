## Request

<ParamField path="destination" type="string" required>
  Destination can either be a topic name or id that you configured in the
  Upstash console, or a valid url where the message gets sent to. Make sure the
  url is prefixed with a valid protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="body" type="string">
  The raw request message passed to the endpoints as is
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Content-Type" type="string" >
ContentType is the MIME type of the message.

We highly recommend sending a `Content-Type` header along, as this will help
your destination API to understand the content of the message.

Set this to whatever data you are sending through QStash, if your message is json, then use `application/json`.
Some frameworks like Next.js will not parse your body correctly if the content type is not correct.

For example `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream`,
`text/plain`

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Method" type="string" default="POST" >
	The HTTP method to use when sending a webhook to your API.

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Delay" type="string" >

Delay the message delivery.

Format for this header is a number followed by duration abbreviation, like
`10s`. Available durations are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d`
(days).

example: "50s" | "3m" | "10h" | "1d"

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Retries" type="int" default={3} >
 How often should this messasge be retried in case the destination API is not available.

The total number of deliveries is therefore capped at `1 + retries`

Leave this empty to use the default value, (free tier: 3, paid tier: 5)

The backoff duration in seconds is calculated as follows: `n` is the number of
times the task has been retried.

`min(86400, e ** (2 * n))`

</ParamField>
<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback" type="string" >
You can define a callback url that will be called with the response from the destination API.
Callbacks are experimental, and the API might change in the future!
- The callback url must be prefixed with a valid protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
- Callbacks are charged as a regular message.
- Callbacks will use the retry setting from the original request.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Forward-*" type="string" >
 You can send custom headers along with your message.

To send a custom header, prefix the header name with `Upstash-Forward-`. We will
strip efix and them to the destination API.

example: "Upstash-Forward-My-Header: my-value" -> "My-Header: my-value"

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Cron" type="string" >
 	Cron allows you to send this message periodically on a schedule.

Add a Cron expression and we will requeue this message automatically whenever
the Cron expression triggers. We offer an easy to use UI for creating Cron
expressions in our [console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) or you can
check out [Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru).

Note: it can take up to 60 seconds until the schedule is registered on an
available qstash node.

Example: `*/5 * * * *`

</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="scheduleId" type="string" required>
  The unique id of this schedule. You can use it to delete the schedule later.
</ResponseField>

```sh
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json 200 OK
