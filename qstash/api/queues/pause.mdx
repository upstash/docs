title: "Pause Queue"
description: "Pause an active queue"
api: "POST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/queues/{queueName}/pause"
authMethod: "bearer"
---

Pausing a queue stops the delivery of enqueued messages. 
The queue will still accept new messages, but they will wait until the queue becomes active for delivery. 
If the queue is already paused, this action has no effect.

## Request

<ParamField path="queueName" type="string" required>
  The name of the queue to pause.
</ParamField>

## Response

This endpoint simply returns 200 OK if the queue is paused successfully.

<RequestExample>

curl -X POST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/queues/queue_1234/pause \

/**

const c = new Client({
  token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>",
