[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) allows you to build and run workflows with
1000s of open source triggers and actions across 900+ apps.

Check out the [official integration](https://pipedream.com/apps/qstash).

## Trigger a Pipedream workflow from a QStash topic message

This is a step by step guide on how to trigger a Pipedream workflow from a
QStash topic message.

Alternatively [click here](https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_3egfAX) to create a
new workflow with this QStash topic trigger added.

### 1. Create a Topic in QStash

If you haven't yet already, create a **Topic** in the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=topics).

### 2. Create a new Pipedream workflow

Sign into [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) and create a new workflow.

### 3. Add QStash Topic Message as a trigger

In the workflow **Trigger** search for QStash and select the **Create Topic
Endpoint** trigger.

![Select the QStash Create Topic Endpoint trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664298855/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_13.13.56_x6gzgk.gif)

Then, connect your QStash account by clicking the QStash prop and retrieving
your token from the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details).

After connecting your QStash account, click the **Topic** prop, a dropdown will
appear containing the QStash topics on your account.

Then _click_ on a specific topic to listen for new messages on.

![Selecting a QStash topic to subscribe to](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664299016/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_13.16.35_rewzbo.gif)

Finally, _click_ **Continue**. Pipedream will create a unique HTTP endpoint and
add it to your QStash topic.

### 4. Test with a sample message

Use the _Request Builder_ in the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details) to publish a
test message to your topic.

Alternatively, you can use the **Create topic message** action in a Pipedream
workflow to send a message to your topic.

_Don't forget_ to use this action in a separate workflow, otherwise you might
cause an inifinite loop of messages between QStash and Pipedream.

### 5. Add additional steps

Add additional steps to the workflow by clicking the plus icon beneath the
Trigger step.

Build a workflow with the 1,000+ pre-built components available in Pipedream,
including [Airtable](https://pipedream.com/apps/airtable),
[Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets),
[Slack](https://pipedream.com/apps/slack) and many more.

Alternatively, use [Node.js](https://pipdream.com/docs/code/nodejs) or
[Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python) code steps to retrieve,
transform, or send data to other services.

### 6. Deploy your Pipedream workflow

After you're satistifed with your changes, click the **Deploy** button in the
top right of your Pipedream workflow. Your deployed workflow will not
automatically process new messages to your QStash topic. Collapse

## Trigger a Pipedream workflow from a QStash topic message

This is a step by step guide on how to trigger a Pipedream workflow from a
QStash endpoint message.

Alternatively [click here](https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_m5ofX6) to create a
pre-configured workflow with the HTTP trigger and QStash webhook verification
step already added.

### 1. Create a new Pipedream workflow

Sign into [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) and create a new workflow.

### 2. Configure the workflow with an HTTP trigger

In the workflow **Trigger** select the **New HTTP / Webhook Requests** option.

![Create new HTTP Webhook trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664296111/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_12.27.42_cqzolg.png)

Pipedream will create a unique HTTP endpoint for your workflow.

Then configure the HTTP trigger to _return a custom response_. By default
Pipedream will always return a 200 response, which allows us to return a non-200
response to QStash to retry the workflow again if there's an error during the
execution of the QStash message.

![Configure the webhook to return a custom response](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664296210/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_12.29.45_jbwtcm.png)

Lastily, set the **Event Body** to be a **Raw request**. This will make sure the
QStash verify webhook action receives the data in the correct format.

![Set the event body to a raw body](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664302540/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_14.15.15_o4xinz.png)

### 3. Test with a sample message

Use the _Request Builder_ in the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details) to publish a
test message to your topic.

Alternatively, you can use the **Create topic message** action in a Pipedream
workflow to send a message to your topic.

_Don't forget_ to use this action in a separate workflow, otherwise you might
cause an inifinite loop of messages between QStash and Pipedream.

### 4. Verify the QStash webhook

Pipedream has a pre-built QStash action that will verify the content of incoming
webhooks from QStash.

First, search for **QStash** in the step search bar, then select the QStash app.

Of the available actions, select the **Verify Webhook** action.

Then connect your QStash account and select the **HTTP request** prop. In the
dropdown, click **Enter custom expression** and then paste in
`{{ steps.trigger.event }}`.

This step will automatically verify the incoming HTTP requests and exit the
workflow early if requests are not from QStash.

### 5. Add additional steps

Add additional steps to the workflow by clicking the plus icon beneath the
Trigger step.

Build a workflow with the 1,000+ pre-built components available in Pipedream,
including [Airtable](https://pipedream.com/apps/airtable),
[Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets),
[Slack](https://pipedream.com/apps/slack) and many more.

Alternatively, use [Node.js](https://pipdream.com/docs/code/nodejs) or
[Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python) code steps to retrieve,
transform, or send data to other services.

### 6. Return a 200 response

In the final step of your workflow, return a 200 response by adding a new step
and selecting **Return an HTTP Response**.

![Returning an HTTP response](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664296812/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_12.39.25_apkngf.png)

This will generate Node.js code to return an HTTP response to QStash using the
`$.respond` helper in Pipedream.

### 7. Deploy your Pipedream workflow

After you're satistifed with your changes, click the **Deploy** button in the
top right of your Pipedream workflow. Your deployed workflow will not
automatically process new messages to your QStash topic.
