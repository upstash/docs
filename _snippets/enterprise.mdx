  databases on different plans in the same account and each is charged
  separately. Pro/Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards
  you can cancel any time.
</Note>

### Pro/Enterprise Plans Network & Storage Costs

In Pro/Enterprise plans, in addition to plan price, you will be charged for
storage and network usage costs.

<Note>
  You can enable VPC Peering to minimize data transfer cost. Contact us
  [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>
#### Storage Cost Storage cost calculation is the same as pay-as-you-go plan which
`$0.25 per GB-month`. The total cost is determined by adding up the storage at all
replica and regions.

#### Network Cost

Network (data transfer) cost is `$0.03 per GB` for databases. For use cases with high volume, you
may consider VPC Peering which minimizes the data transfer cost.

<Note>
  The above pricing assumes that the clients and database are in the same cloud
  provider. If not, you may be charged at a higher rate proportional to what
  cloud providers charge us. Contact us
  [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

### Pro/Enterprise Addons

The following are special features which we are provided on your request with an
extra fee. Please contact us to learn about their pricing.

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IP Whitelisting**           | You can set the IP addresses which will have access to your database.                                                                                                                |
| **TLS Mutual Authentication** | mTLS ensures two-way authentication where both client and server authenticate each other at the same time in the authentication protocol.                                            |
| **VPC Peering**               | VPC Peering enables you to connect to Upstash from your own VPC using private IP. Database and your application can run in the same subnet which also minimizes data transfer costs. |
