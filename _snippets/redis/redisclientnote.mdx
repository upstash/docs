<Note>
  This tutorial uses [@upstash/redis](/redis/sdks/ts/overview) which is
  designed for serverless runtimes for efficient connection handling. You can
  use your favorite Redis client, but you may have to deal with connection
  issues as described
  [here](https://upstash.com/blog/serverless-database-connections).
