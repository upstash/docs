<ParamField body="body" type="string">
  The raw request message passed to the endpoints as is
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Content-Type" type="string" >
ContentType is the MIME type of the message.

We highly recommend sending a `Content-Type` header along, as this will help
your destination API to understand the content of the message.

Set this to whatever data you are sending through QStash, if your message is json, then use `application/json`.
Some frameworks like Next.js will not parse your body correctly if the content type is not correct.

For example `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream`,
`text/plain`
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Method" type="string" default="POST" >
	The HTTP method to use when sending a webhook to your API.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Timeout" type="string" >
  Timeout value to set how long your endpoint is going to take. 
  This parameter can be used to shorten the default allowed timeout value on your plan. Examples: 1 second = "1s", 5 minutes = "5m", 2 hours = "2h"
  See `Max HTTP Connection Timeout` on [the pricing page](https://upstash.com/pricing/qstash) for default values.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Retries" type="int" default={3} >
 How often should this message be retried in case the destination API is not available.

The total number of deliveries is therefore capped at `1 + retries`

Leave this empty to use the default value, (free tier: 3, paid tier: 5)

The backoff duration in seconds is calculated as follows: `n` is the number of
times the task has been retried.

`min(86400, e ** (2 * n))`
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Forward-*" type="string" >
 You can send custom headers along with your message.

To send a custom header, prefix the header name with `Upstash-Forward-`. We will
strip efix and them to the destination API.

example: "Upstash-Forward-My-Header: my-value" -> "My-Header: my-value"
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback" type="string" >
You can define a callback url that will be called after each attempt. 
See the content of what will be delivered to a callback [here](/qstash/features/callbacks#how-do-i-use-callbacks) 
- The callback url must be prefixed with a valid protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
- Callbacks are charged as a regular message.
- Callbacks will use the retry setting from the original request.

For the `api/llm` destination, specifying a callback is required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback-Timeout" type="string" >
Defines the timeout applied when calling the `Upstash-Callback`. See [the Configuring Callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks) section to learn more.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback-Retries" type="string" >
Defines the number of retries when calling the `Upstash-Callback`. See [the Configuring Callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks) section to learn more.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback-Delay" type="string" >
Defines the delay to apply when calling the `Upstash-Callback`. See [the Configuring Callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks) section to learn more.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Callback-Forward-*" type="string" >
 If you are using the `Upstash-Callback` header to define a callback url,
 you can specify the headers sent along with the callback request using
 the `Upstash-Callback-Forward-*` header.

To include a header in the callback request, prefix the header name with
`Upstash-Callback-Forward-`. We will strip this prefix and forward the header to the callback destination..

example: "Upstash-Callback-Forward-My-Header: my-value" -> "My-Header: my-value"

To learn more about how callbacks can be configured, see the [Configuring Callbacks section](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks).
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Failure-Callback" type="string" >
You can define a failure callback url that will be called when a delivery is failed. 
That is when all the defined retries are exhausted.
See the content of what will be delivered to a failure callback [here](/qstash/features/callbacks#what-is-a-failure-callback) 

- The failure callback url must be prefixed with a valid protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
- Callbacks are charged as a regular message.
- Callbacks will use the retry setting from the original request.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Failure-Callback-Timeout" type="string" >
Defines the timeout applied when calling the `Upstash-Failure-Callback`. See [the Configuring Callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks) section to learn more.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Failure-Callback-Retries" type="string" >
Defines the number of retries when calling the `Upstash-Failure-Callback`. See [the Configuring Callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks) section to learn more.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Failure-Callback-Delay" type="string" >
Defines the delay to apply when calling the `Upstash-Failure-Callback`. See [the Configuring Callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks#configuring-callbacks) section to learn more.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Upstash-Failure-Callback-Forward-*" type="string" >
 If are you using the `Upstash-Failure-Callback` header to define a callback url
 when the delivery fails, you can specify the headers sent along with the failure
 callback request using the `Upstash-Failure-Callback-Forward-*` header.

To include a header in the callback request, add `Upstash-Failure-Callback-Forward-` prefix to the header name.
We will strip this prefix and forward the header to the callback destination.

example: "Upstash-Failure-Callback-Forward-My-Header: my-value" -> "My-Header: my-value"
