## Importing Data

You can import data into your Upstash Redis database from two sources: an existing backup or an RDB file.

<Warning>
  All existing data in the target database will be deleted before the import operation begins.
</Warning>

### Start an Import

To begin importing data:

- Go to the [Redis database list page](https://console.upstash.com/redis) in the Upstash console
- Click on the `Import...` button

</Frame>

You'll see a dialog with two import options:

### Option 1: Import from Backup

Import data from a backup of any existing database in your account or team:

- Select `From Backup` as the source
- Choose the source database (the database from which the backup was created)
- Select the backup you want to import from
- Select the target database (the database you want to import into)
- Click `Start Import`

</Frame>

### Option 2: Import from RDB File

Import data from an external Redis database by uploading an RDB file:

- Select `From RDB File` as the source
- Click `Upload RDB File` and select your RDB file
- Select the target database (the database you want to import into)
- Click `Start Import`

</Frame>

<Info>
  If you're importing from an external Redis database (from another provider or on-premise), you'll need to export it as an RDB file first.
</Info>

## Exporting Data

<Warning>
  **Coming Soon**: The export feature is not yet available but will be released soon. The following documentation describes how it will work.
</Warning>

You'll be able to export your Upstash Redis database as an RDB file for backup or migration purposes.

### Request an Export

To export your database:

- Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
- Click on the `Backup & Export` button
- Choose `Export`

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/backuprestore/export-button.png" width="800" />
</Frame>

Your database will be exported as an RDB file. Once you start the export, you'll see the export progress in the backups table.

### Download Your Export

Once the export completes, you'll see a `Download` button in the backups table:

- Find your export in the backups table
- Click the `Download` button to download the RDB file

<Info>
  Not all Redis data structures are included in RDB exports. Notably, Redis Functions data will not be available in the export.
</Info>

## Using upstash-redis-dump

You can also use the [upstash-redis-dump](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis-dump) tool to import/export data from another Redis.

The below is an example of how to dump and import data:

```shell
$ upstash-redis-dump -db 0 -host eu1-moving-loon-6379.upstash.io -port 6379 -pass PASSWORD -tls > redis.dump
Database 0: 9 keys dumped
```

See [upstash-redis-dump repo](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis-dump) for more information.
