We support the Redis `MONITOR` command, a debugging command that allows you to see all requests processed by your Redis instance in real-time.

## Monitoring Your Usage - Video Guide

In this video, we'll walk through setting up a monitor instance step-by-step.

<Note>
  The `MONITOR`command expects a persistent connection and, therefore, does not
  work over HTTP.
</Note>

In this video, we use `ioredis` to connect to our Upstash Redis database. Using an event handler, we can define what should happen for each executed command against on Redis instance. For example, logging all data to the console.

<RequestExample>
```ts Example
const monitor = await redis.monitor()

monitor.on("monitor", (time, args, source, database) => {
console.log(time, args, source, database)
})

```
</RequestExample>
```
