title: Migrate Regional to Global Database
---

This guide will help you migrate your data from a regional Upstash Redis database to a global database.
If your database is Upstash Regional, we strongly recommend you to migrate to [Upstash Redis Global](/common/concepts/global-replication).
Our Regional Redis databases are legacy and deprecated.

## Why Migrate?

- New infrastructure, more modern and more secure
- Upstash Global is SOC-2 (included with Prod pack) and HIPAA (included with Enterprise) compatible
- Enhanced feature set: New features are only made available on Upstash Global
- Ability to add/remove read regions on the go
- Better performance as per our benchmarks

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, make sure you have:

1. An existing regional Upstash Redis database (source)
2. A new global Upstash Redis database (destination)
3. Access to both databases' credentials (connection strings, passwords)

## Migration Process

You can migrate your data without leaving Upstash Console:

   <Warning>
     If you are using RBAC, please note that they are not migrated automatically. You need to redefine ACL users for new the global database after migration.
   </Warning>

1. Create a backup of your regional database:
   - Go to your regional database details page
   - Navigate to the `Backups` tab
   - Click the `Backup` button
   - Provide a unique name for your backup
   - Wait for the backup process to complete

   <Info>
     During a backup operation, certain administrative operations will be temporarily unavailable: Backup operations, database config changes, plan and region setup, transferring database.
     Regular Redis commands (GET, SET, etc.) are not blocked and continue to work normally.
   </Info>

2. Restore the backup to your global database:
   - Go to your new global database's details page
   - Navigate to the `Backups` tab
   - Click `Restore...`
   - Select your regional database as the source
   - Select the backup you created
   - Click `Start Restore`

   <Warning>
     The restore operation will flush (delete) all existing data in your (destination) global database before restoring the backup.
   </Warning>

## Verification

After migration, verify your data:

1. Compare key counts in both databases
2. Sample test some keys to ensure data integrity

## Post-Migration Steps

1. Update your application configuration to use the new Global database URL
2. Test your application thoroughly with the new database
3. Monitor performance and consistency across regions
4. Keep the regional database as backup for a few days
5. Once verified, you can safely delete the regional database
