title: Upgrade Your Database
---

Free tier has followings restrictions:

- Max 10.000 requests per day
- Max 256 MB data size
- Max 1 database

If you think your database is close to reaching any of these limits, we
recommend you to upgrade to pay-as-you-go plan which includes:

- No limit on requests per day
- Data size up to 10 GB

To upgrade your database, you need to have a payment method. You can add a
payment method as described [here](../account/addapaymentmethod). After you add
a payment method, Upstash restarts your database and your new database starts
with the pay-as-you-go plan.

See the [quotas](../overall/pricing#pay-as-you-go-plan-quotas) for limits of the
pay-as-you-go plan. If you think, your use case will exceed those quotas,
contact us (support@upstash.com) for our [Enterprise Plan](#enterprise-plan)
where you can customize the limits.

<Note>
    During the upgrade process, you will not lose any data but your database
    will experience a downtime about 1-2 seconds. Your existing clients will be
    disconnected. So it is recommended to upgrade your database when there is
    the least activity.
