title: Upgrade Your Database
---

Free tier has followings restrictions:

- Max 500K commands per month
- Max 256MB data size
- One free database per account

If you think your database is close to reaching any of these limits, we
recommend you to upgrade to pay-as-you-go plan which includes:

- No limit on requests per day
- Data size up to 100 GB

To upgrade your database, you need to have a payment method. You can add a
payment method as described [here](/common/account/addapaymentmethod). After you add
a payment method, Upstash restarts your database and your new database starts
with the pay-as-you-go plan.

See the [Pricing & Limits](../overall/pricing) for limits of the
pay-as-you-go and fixed plans. If you think, your use case will exceed those quotas,
contact us (support@upstash.com) for our [Enterprise Plan](../overall/enterprise)
where you can customize the limits.

<Note>
  During the upgrade process, you will not lose any data but your database will
  experience a downtime about 1-2 seconds. Your existing clients will be
  disconnected. So it is recommended to upgrade your database when there is the
  least activity.
