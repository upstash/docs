title: Get Started with AWS Lambda

You can connect to Upstash database from your Lambda functions using your
favorite Redis client. You do not need any extra configuration. The only thing
to note is you should use the same region for your Lambda function and database
to minimize latency.

If you do not have any experience with AWS Lambda functions, you can follow the
following tutorial. The tutorial explains the required steps to implement an AWS
Lambda function that takes the key/value as parameters from APIGateway then
inserts an entry (key/value) to the database which is on Upstash. We have
implemented the function in Node.js, but the steps and the logic are quite
similar in other languages.

:::note
This example uses Redis clients. If you expect many concurrent AWS Lambda invocation then we recommend using **[upstash-redis](connectwithupstashredis.md)** which is HTTP/REST based.  
:::

**Step 1: Create database on Upstash**

If you do not have one, create a database following
this [guide](../overall/getstarted.md).

**Step 2: Create a Node project**

Create an empty folder for your project and inside the folder create a node
project with the command:

```
npm init
```

Then install the redis client with:

```
npm install ioredis
```

Now create index.js file. Replace the Redis URL in the below code.

<IORedisNote />

```javascript
var Redis = require("ioredis");

if (typeof client === "undefined") {
    var client = new Redis("rediss://:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_ENDPOINT:YOUR_PORT");
}
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    await client.set("foo", "bar");
    let result = await client.get("foo");
    let response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({
            result: result,
        }),
    };
    return response;
};
```

**Step 3: Deploy Your Function**

Our function is ready to deploy. Normally you could copy-paste your function
code to AWS Lambda editor. But here it is not possible because we have an extra
dependency (redis-client). So we will zip and upload our function.

When you are in your project folder, create a zip with this command:

```
zip -r app.zip .
```

Now open your AWS console, from the top-right menu, select the region that you
created your database in Upstash. Then find or search the lambda service, click
on `Create Function` button.

<Frame>
    <img class="ss" src="/img/awslambda/createfunction.png" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Enter a name for your function and select `Node.js 14.x` as runtime.
Click `Create Function`.

Now you are on the function screen, scroll below to `Function Code` section.
On `Code entry type` selection, select `Upload a .zip file`. Upload
the `app.zip` file you have just created and click on the `Save` button on the
top-right. You need to see your code as below:

<Frame>
    <img class="ss" src="/img/awslambda/functioncode.png" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Now you can test your code. Click on the `Test` button on the top right. Create
an event like the below:

```
{
  "key": "foo",
  "value": "bar"
}
```

Now, click on Test. You will see something like this:

<Frame>
    <img class="ss" src="/img/awslambda/success.png" width="100%" />
</Frame>

Congratulations, now your lambda function inserts entry to your Upstash
database.

**What can be the next?**

-   You can write and deploy another function to just get values from the
    database.
-   You can learn better ways to deploy your functions such
    as [serverless framework](https://serverless.com/)
    and [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
-   You can
    integrate [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html)
    so you can call your function via http.
-   You can learn about how to monitor your functions from CloudWatch as
    described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg//monitoring-functions-logs.html)
    .

#### Redis Connections in AWS Lambda

Although Redis connections are very lightweight, a new connection inside each
Lambda function can cause a notable latency. On the other hand, reusing Redis
connections inside the AWS Lambda functions has its own drawbacks. When AWS
scales out Lambda functions, the number of open connections can rapidly
increase. Fortunately, Upstash detects and terminates the idle and zombie
connections thanks to its smart connection handling algorithm. Since this
algorithm is used; we have been recommending caching your Redis connection in
serverless functions.

about the database connections in serverless functions.

Below is our findings about various Redis clients' behaviours when connection is
created, a single command is submitted and then connection is closed. **Note
that these commands (AUTH, INFO, PING, QUIT, COMMAND) are not billed.**

| Client                                                | #Commands |  Issued Commands   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :----------------: |
| [redis-cli](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli)         |     2     |   AUTH - COMMAND   |
| [node-redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node-redis) |     3     | AUTH - INFO - QUIT |
| [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis)            |     3     | AUTH - INFO - QUIT |
| [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)   |     1     |        AUTH        |
| [jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis)           |     2     |    AUTH - QUIT     |
| [lettuce](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core) |     2     |    AUTH - QUIT     |
| [go-redis](https://github.com/go-redis/redis)         |     1     |        AUTH        |
