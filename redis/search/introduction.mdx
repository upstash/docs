Upstash Redis Search is our first extension beyond the official Redis spec. Using the Rust-based Tantivy under the hood, we provide an extremely fast way to search through Redis data.

- **Easy Integration**: Works with JSON, Hashes and Strings out of the box
- **Auto-Synchronization**: Once you created an index, all write operations are automatically tracked
- **Intuitive Query Language**: A type-safe JSON-based query syntax with boolean operators, fuzzy matching, phrase queries,
  regex support, and more.
- **Production-Ready Performance**: Built on Tantivy, a fast full-text search engine library written in Rust
