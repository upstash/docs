Modern applications often need to search through large volumes of data stored in Redis.
While Redis excels at key-value operations, it lacks native full-text search capabilities.
This feature bridges that gap by providing:

- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly with your existing Redis data structures (JSON, Hash, String) without
  requiring data migration or duplication to external systems.
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Once an index is created, all write operations to matching keys are automatically
  tracked and reflected in the index—no manual indexing required.
- **Powerful Query Language**: A JSON-based query syntax with boolean operators, fuzzy matching, phrase queries,
  regex support, and more.
- **Production-Ready Performance**: Built on Tantivy, a fast full-text search engine library written in Rust,
  the same technology that powers search engines handling millions of queries.

Whether you're building a product catalog search, a document management system, or a user directory,
this feature allows you to add sophisticated search capabilities to your Redis-backed application with minimal effort.
