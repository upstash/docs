title: $fuzzy
---

The `$fuzzy` operator matches terms that are similar but not identical to the search term.
This is useful for handling typos, misspellings, and minor variations in user input.

### Levenshtein Distance

Fuzzy matching uses Levenshtein distance (also called edit distance) to measure similarity between terms.
The distance is the minimum number of single-character edits needed to transform one word into another.
These edits include:

- **Insertions:** Adding a character ("headphone" → "headphones")
- **Deletions:** Removing a character ("headphones" → "headphone")
- **Substitutions:** Replacing a character ("headphones" → "headphonez")

For example, the Levenshtein distance between "headphons" and "headphones" is 1 (one insertion needed).

### Distance Parameter

The `distance` parameter sets the maximum Levenshtein distance allowed for a match.
The default is 1, and the maximum allowed value is 2.

| Distance | Matches |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Words with 1 edit (handles most single typos) |
| 2 | Words with up to 2 edits (handles more severe misspellings) |

Higher distances match more terms but may include unintended matches, so use distance 2 only when needed.

### Transposition Cost

A transposition swaps two adjacent characters (e.g., "teh" → "the").
By default, a transposition counts as 1 edit.
Setting `transpositionCostOne: false` counts transpositions as two edits (one deletion + one insertion) instead.

For example, searching for "haedphone" to find "headphone":
- With `transpositionCostOne: true`: Distance is 1 (swap counts as 1)
- Without `transpositionCostOne`: Distance is 2 (swap "ae" → "ea" costs 2)

This is useful when users commonly transpose characters while typing quickly.

### Prefix Matching

Setting `prefix: true` enables fuzzy prefix matching, which matches terms that start with a fuzzy
variation of the search term. This combines the typo tolerance of fuzzy matching with prefix
matching for incomplete words.

For example, searching for "headpho" with `prefix: true`:
- Matches "headphones" (prefix match)
- Matches "headphone" (prefix match)
- Matches "haedphones" with `transpositionCostOne: true` (fuzzy prefix, handles typo + incomplete word)

This is particularly useful for search-as-you-type autocomplete where users may have typos
in partially typed words.

### Stemming Behavior

On fields with stemming enabled (the default), fuzzy matching operates on the stemmed form of terms.
For example, "running" is stored as "run", so searching for "runing" (one typo) would match.

For predictable fuzzy matching, consider using `NOSTEM` on fields where you need to match the original word forms.
See [Text Field Options](../../schema-definition#text-field-options) for more details.

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```ts
// Simple fuzzy (distance 1, handles single typos)
// Matches "headphone" even with the typo "headphon"
await products.query({
  filter: {
    name: { $fuzzy: "headphon" },
  },
});

// Custom distance for more tolerance
// "haedphone" is 2 edits away from "headphone" without taking transposition into account
await products.query({
  filter: {
    name: {
      $fuzzy: {
        value: "haedphone",
        distance: 2,
        transpositionCostOne: false,
      },
    },
  },
});

// Handle character transpositions efficiently
// "haedphone" has swapped "ae", with transpositionCostOne this is 1 edit
await products.query({
  filter: {
    name: {
      $fuzzy: {
        value: "haedphone",
        distance: 1,
        transpositionCostOne: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

// Combine prefix with transposition for robust autocomplete
// Handles both typos and incomplete input like "haedpho" → "headphones"
await products.query({
  filter: {
    name: {
      $fuzzy: {
        value: "haedpho",
        prefix: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
