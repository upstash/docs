title: $ne
---

The `$ne` (not equal) operator excludes documents where the field matches a specific value.
This operator works as a filter, removing matching documents from the result set rather than adding to it.

Because `$ne` only filters results, it must be combined with other conditions that produce a base result set.
A query using only `$ne` conditions returns no results since there is nothing to filter.

This behavior is similar to the [`$mustNot`](../boolean-operators/must-not) boolean operator,
but `$ne` operates at the field level rather than combining multiple conditions.
