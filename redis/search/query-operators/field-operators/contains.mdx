title: $contains
---

The `$contains` operator is designed for search-as-you-type and autocomplete scenarios.
It matches documents where the field contains all the specified terms, with the last term treated as a prefix.

For example, searching for `"noise cancel"` matches documents containing:
- "noise cancelling" (the "cancel" prefix matches "cancelling")
- "noise cancellation"
- "noise cancelled"

This differs from a simple term search because complete words must match exactly,
while only the last word can be a partial match.
This makes it ideal for search boxes where users type incrementally.
