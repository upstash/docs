title: $boost
---

The `$boost` operator adjusts the relevance score contribution of a field match.
This allows you to prioritize certain matches over others in the result ranking.

### How Boosting Works

Search results are ordered by a relevance score that reflects how well each document matches the query.
By default, all matching conditions contribute equally to this score.
The `$boost` operator multiplies a match's score contribution by the specified factor.

- **Positive values greater than 1** increase the match's importance (e.g., `$boost: 2.0` doubles the contribution)
- **Values between 0 and 1** decrease the match's importance
- **Negative values** demote matches, pushing them lower in results

### Use Cases

- **Prioritize premium content:** Boost matches in title fields over body text
- **Promote featured items:** Give higher scores to promoted products
- **Demote less relevant matches:** Use negative boosts to push certain matches down

### Compatibility

The `$boost` operator can be used with any field type since it modifies the score rather than the matching behavior.

| Field Type | Supported |
|------------|-----------|
| TEXT | Yes |
| U64/I64/F64 | Yes |
| DATE | Yes |
| BOOL | Yes |
