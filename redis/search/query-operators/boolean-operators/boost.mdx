title: $boost
---

The `$boost` operator adjusts the score contribution of a boolean clause.
Use it to fine-tune how much weight specific conditions have in the overall relevance ranking.

By default, all matching conditions contribute equally to a document's relevance score.
The `$boost` operator multiplies a clause's score contribution by the specified factor:

- **Values greater than 1** increase importance (e.g., `$boost: 5.0` makes the clause 5x more important)
- **Values between 0 and 1** decrease importance
- **Negative values** demote matches, pushing them lower in results

The most common use case is boosting specific `$should` conditions to prioritize certain matches:

```ts
{
  $must: { category: "electronics" },
  $should: [
    { description: "premium", $boost: 10.0 },  // High priority
    { description: "featured", $boost: 5.0 },  // Medium priority
    { description: "sale" }                    // Normal priority (default boost: 1.0)
  ]
}
```

Documents matching "premium" rank significantly higher than those matching only "sale".

Negative boost values demote matches without excluding them entirely.
This is useful when you want to push certain results lower without filtering them out:

```ts
{
  $must: { category: "electronics" },
  $should: {
    description: "budget",
    $boost: -2.0  // Push budget items lower in results
  }
}
```

Unlike `$mustNot`, which excludes documents entirely, negative boosting keeps documents in results but ranks them lower.
