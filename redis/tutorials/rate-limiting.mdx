title: "AWS Lambda Rate Limiting with Serverless Redis"

description: "This tutorial shows how to limit rate in AWS Lambda with Serverless Redis."
---

UPDATE: We have developed
[Upstash Rate Limiting SDK](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit). We recommend
it with Upstash Redis.

In this tutorial, we will throttle AWS Lambda functions using Serverless Redis
based on the client's IP address.

See
[code](https://github.com/upstash/examples/tree/master/serverless-rate-limiting).

See [demo](https://5hg3vtj7gk.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hello).

### `1` Serverless Project Setup

If you do not have it already, install serverless framework via:
`npm install -g serverless`

In any folder run `serverless` as below:

```text
>> serverless

Serverless: No project detected. Do you want to create a new one? Yes
Serverless: What do you want to make? AWS Node.js
Serverless: What do you want to call this project? serverless-rate-limiting

Project successfully created in 'serverless-rate-limiting' folder.

You can monitor, troubleshoot, and test your new service with a free Serverless account.

Serverless: Would you like to enable this? No
You can run the “serverless” command again if you change your mind later.
```

<Note>
See [Using AWS SAM](/redis/tutorials/using_aws_sam), if you prefer AWS SAM over Serverless Framework.
</Note>

Inside the project folder create a node project with the command:

```
npm init
```

Then install the redis client and rate limiting libraries with:

```
npm install ioredis async-ratelimiter request-ip
```

Update the `serverless.yml` as below. Copy your Redis URL from console and
replace below:

```yaml
service: serverless-rate-limiting
frameworkVersion: '2'
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - httpApi:
          path: /hello
          method: get
```

<Note>
For the best performance choose the same region for your Lambda function and Upstash database.
</Note>

### `2` Create a Redis (Upstash) Database

Create a database from [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com)

### `3` Code

Edit handler.js and replace your REDIS_URL below.

import IORedisNote from '../howto/ioredisnote'

<IORedisNote />

```javascript
const RateLimiter = require("async-ratelimiter");
const Redis = require("ioredis");
const { getClientIp } = require("request-ip");

const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
  db: new Redis("YOUR_REDIS_URL"),
  max: 1,
  duration: 5_000,
});

module.exports.hello = async (event) => {
  const clientIp = getClientIp(event) || "NA";
  const limit = await rateLimiter.get({ id: clientIp });
  if (!limit.remaining) {
    return {
      statusCode: 429,
      body: JSON.stringify(
        {
          message: "Sorry, you are rate limited. Wait for 5 seconds",
        },
      ),
    };
  }

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(
      {
        message: "hello!",
      },
    ),
  };
};
```

Above, we have configured the rate limiting to accept 1 request from the same IP
address in 5 seconds.

### `4` Deploy and Try the API

Deploy your functions with:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The command will deploy the function and show the endpoint url. Click to the
endpoint url. If you refresh your page, you will see that your request is
throttled.
