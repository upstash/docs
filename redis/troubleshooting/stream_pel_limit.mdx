title: ERR XReadGroup is cancelled
---

### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR XReadGroup is cancelled. Pending Entries List limit per consumer is about to be reached. Limit: 1000, Current PEL size: 90, Requested Read: 20, Key: mstream, Group: group1, Consumer: consumer1.
```

### Diagnosis
Pending Entries List of the stream for the consumer is full. For each consumer in a consumer group, there is a pending entries list.
This list keeps the messages that are delivered to a consumer but not yet acknowledged via [XACK](https://redis.io/commands/xack/). This list is populated via [XREADGROUP](https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/).

### Solution 

Acknowledge the consumed messages via [XACK](https://redis.io/commands/xack/) from the list of the associated group and consumer.
