title: ERR max member size exceeded
---

### Symptom

The client gets an exception similar to:

```
ReplyError: ERR max member size exceeded. Limit: X bytes, Actual: Z bytes
```

### Diagnosis

Size of a SET or ZSET member in the request exceeds the max member size limit,
which is `32Kb`.

### Solution

This is a hardcoded limit and cannot be configured per database. You should
reduce the member sizes in SET and ZSET entries.
