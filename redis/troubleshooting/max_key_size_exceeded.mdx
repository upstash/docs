id: max_key_size_exceeded
title: ERR max key size exceeded
---

### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR max key size exceeded. Limit: X bytes, Actual: Z bytes 
```

### Diagnosis
Size of the key in the request exceeds the max key size limit, which is `32Kb`.

### Solution
This is a hardcoded limit and cannot be configured per database. You should reduce the key size.
