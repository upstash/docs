title: ERR max single record size exceeded
---

### Symptom

The client gets an exception similar to:

```
ReplyError: ERR max single record size exceeded
```

### Diagnosis

An entry size exceeds the max record size limit which is `100Mb` for "Free" and
"Pay as you go" databases. You may reach this limit either by inserting a single
huge value or appending many small values to an entry. This entry can be a
String, List, Set, Hash etc. Read (`GET`, `LRANGE`, `HMGET`, `ZRANGE` etc) and
delete (`DEL`, `LPOP`, `HDEL`, `SREM` etc) requests will not be affected.

### Solution-1

You can split your data into smaller chunks and store them as separate entries
with different keys.

### Solution-2

You can upgrade your database to Pro/Enterprise as it has higher limits. Also
you can submit quota increase request in the console or contact
support@upstash.com about the options with higher max record size limit.
