title: ERR max request size exceeded
---

### Symptom

The client gets an exception similar to:

```
ReplyError: ERR max request size exceeded
```

### Diagnosis

Your command exceeds the max request size which is `10MB` for "Free" and "Pay as
you go" databases.

### Solution-1

You can split your data into smaller chunks and send them in separate commands.

### Solution-2

You can upgrade your database to a higher plan, or apply a custom quota increase if you are on Pay-as-You-Go plan. Please reach out to support@upstash.com about the options with higher max request size limit.

<Note>
  max-request-size-limit is about the size of a single request. Your data
  structure (like list, set) can exceed the max request size limit without any
  problem. If you try to load all elements in the list with a single request
  then it can throw the max-request-size-limit exception.
