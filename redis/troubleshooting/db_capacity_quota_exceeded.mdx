title: ERR DB capacity quota exceeded
---

### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR DB capacity quota exceeded
```

### Diagnosis

Your total database size exceeds the max data size limit, which is `256Mb` for "Free" and `10Gb` for "Pay as you go" databases.
When this limit is reached, write requests may be rejected. Read and delete requests will not be affected.

### Solution-1
You can manually delete some entries to allow further writes. Additionally you can consider setting TTL (expiration time) for your keys
or enable [eviction](../features/eviction) for your database.

### Solution-2
You can upgrade your database to Pro/Enterprise for higher limits.
