title: ERR DB capacity quota exceeded
---

### Symptom

The client gets an exception similar to:

```
ReplyError: ERR DB capacity quota exceeded
```

### Diagnosis

Your total database size exceeds the max data size limit of your current plan. When this limit is reached,
write requests may be rejected. Read and delete requests will not be affected.

### Solution-1

You can manually delete some entries to allow further writes. Additionally you
can consider setting TTL (expiration time) for your keys or enable
[eviction](../features/eviction) for your database.

### Solution-2

You can upgrade your database to Pro for higher limits.
