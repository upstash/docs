id: http_unauthorized
title: WRONGPASS invalid or missing auth token
---

### Symptom

The database rejects your request with an error similar to:

```
UpstashError: WRONGPASS invalid or missing auth token
```

### Diagnosis

The server rejects your request because the auth token is missing or invalid.

Most likely you have forgotten to set it in your environment variables, or you are using a wrong token.

The connection password can only be used in traditional Redis clients. If
you want to connect over HTTP, you need to use the HTTP auth token.

### Solution


1. Check that you have set the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in your environment variables
   and it is loaded correctly by your application at runtime.

2. Make sure you are using the correct HTTP auth token. You can copy the correct
client configuration from the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/redis)
by copying the snippet from the `Connect to your database` -> `@upstash/redis`
tab

Or scroll further down to the `REST API` section and copy the
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from there.
