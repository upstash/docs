### Database Setup

Create a Redis database using [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) or
[Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli). Select the global to minimize the
latency from all edge locations. Copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` for the next steps.

### Project Setup

We will use Fastly CLI for deployment, so please install
[Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/cli/).

Create a folder for your project and run `fastly init`. Select `[2] JavaScript`,
then `[2] Empty starter for JavaScript`

```shell
> fastly compute init

Creating a new Compute@Edge project.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Description:
Author: [enes@upstash.com]
Language:
[1] Rust
[2] JavaScript
[3] AssemblyScript (beta)
[4] Other ('bring your own' Wasm binary)
Choose option: [1] 2
Starter kit:
[1] Default starter for JavaScript
    A basic starter kit that demonstrates routing, simple synthetic responses and
    overriding caching rules.
    https://github.com/fastly/compute-starter-kit-javascript-default
[2] Empty starter for JavaScript
    An empty application template for the Fastly Compute@Edge environment which simply
    returns a 200 OK response.

Choose option or paste git URL: [1] 2
```

Install @upstash/redis:

```shell
npm install @upstash/redis
```

Now, we will create a Fastly Compute service by running,
`fastly compute publish`. You need to add your Upstash database's endpoint as a
backend and select 443 as its port.

```shell
> fastly compute publish

SUCCESS: Built package 'fastly-upstash' (pkg/fastly-upstash.tar.gz)


There is no Fastly service associated with this package. To connect to an existing service
add the Service ID to the fastly.toml file, otherwise follow the prompts to create a
service now.

```

### The Code

Update `src/index.js` as below:

```js
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/fastly";

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(handleRequest(event)));

async function handleRequest(event) {
  const redis = new Redis({
    url: "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL",
    token: "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN",
    backend: "upstash",
  });
  const data = await redis.incr("count");
  return new Response("View Count:" + data, { status: 200 });
}
```

### Deploy

Deploy: `fastly compute deploy`

After deployment, the CLI logs the endpoint. You can check the logs with:
`fastly log-tail --service-id=<YOUR_FASTLY_SERVICE_ID>`

### Run Locally

To run the function locally add the backend to your `fastly.toml` as below:

```toml
[local_server.backends.upstash]
url = "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL"
```

Then run: `fastly compute serve`
