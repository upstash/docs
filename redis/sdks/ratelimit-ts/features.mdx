## Caching

For extreme load or denial of service attacks, it might be too expensive to call
redis for every incoming request, just to find out it should be blocked because
they have exceeded the limit.

You can use an ephemeral in memory cache by passing some variable of type
`Map<string, number>` as the `ephemeralCache` option:

```ts
const cache = new Map(); // must be outside of your serverless function handler

// ...

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  // ...
  ephemeralCache: cache,
});
```

By default, `ephemeralCache` will be initialized with `new Map()` if no value is provided
as the `ephemeralCache` parameter. To disable the cache, one must pass `ephemeralCache: false`.

If enabled, the ratelimiter will keep track of the blocked identifiers and their
reset timestamps. When a request is received with some identifier `ip1` before the reset time of
`ip1`, the request will be denied without having to call Redis. [`reason` field of the
limit response will be `cacheBlock`](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/sdks/ratelimit-ts/methods#limit)

In serverless environments this is only possible if you create the cache or ratelimiter
instance outside of your handler function. While the function is still hot, the
ratelimiter can block requests without having to request data from Redis, thus
saving time and money.

See the section on how caching impacts the cost in the
[costs page](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/sdks/ratelimit-ts/costs#cache-result).

## Timeout

You can define an optional timeout in milliseconds, after which the request will
be allowed to pass regardless of what the current limit is. This can be useful
if you don't want network issues to cause your application to reject requests.

```ts
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"),
  timeout: 1000, // 1 second
  analytics: true,
});
```

Default value of the timeout is 5 seconds if no `timeout` is provided. When response
is success because of a timeout, this is shown in
[the `reason` field of the limit method](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/sdks/ratelimit-ts/methods#limit).

## Analytics & Dashboard

Another feature of the rate limiting algorithm is to collect analytics.

By default, analytics is disabled. To enable analytics, simply set the `analytics` parameter to `true`:

```js
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis,
  analytics: true,
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(60, "10s"),
});
```

Everytime we call `ratelimit.limit()`, analytics will be sent to the Redis database
([see costs page](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/sdks/ratelimit-ts/costs#analytics))
and information about the hour, identifier and the number of rate limit success and
failures will be collected. This information can be viewed from the Upstash console.

If you are using rate limiting in Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge or a similar environment,
you need to make sure that the analytics request is delivered correctly to the Redis.
Otherwise, you may observe lower numbers than the actual number of calls.

To make sure that the request completes, you can use the `pending` field returned by
the `limit` method. See the
[Asynchronous synchronization between databases](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/sdks/ratelimit-ts/features#asynchronous-synchronization-between-databases)
section to see how `pending` can be used.

### Dashboard

If the analytics is enabled, you can find information about how many requests were made
with which identifiers and how many of the requests were blocked from the [Rate Limit
dashboard in Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/ratelimit).

To find the dashboard, simply click the three dots and choose the "Rate Limit Analytics" tab:

![navigate.png](/img/ratelimit/navigate.png)

In the dashboard, you can find information on how many requests were accepted, how many were blocked
and how many were received in total. Additionally, you can see requests over time; top allowed, rate limited
and denied requests.

![dashboard.png](/img/ratelimit/dashboard.png)

**Allowed requests** show the identifiers of the requests which succeeded. **Rate limited requests** show the
identifiers of the requests which were blocked because they surpassed the limit. **Denied requests** show the identifier,
user agent, country, or the IP address which caused the request to fail.

If you are using a custom prefix, you need to use the same in the dashboardâ€™s top left corner.

## Using Multiple Limits

Sometimes you might want to apply different limits to different users. For
example you might want to allow 10 requests per 10 seconds for free users, but
60 requests per 10 seconds for paid users.

Here's how you could do that:

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";

const redis = Redis.fromEnv();

const ratelimit = {
  free: new Ratelimit({
    redis,
    analytics: true,
    prefix: "ratelimit:free",
    limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10s"),
  }),
  paid: new Ratelimit({
    redis,
    analytics: true,
    prefix: "ratelimit:paid",
    limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(60, "10s"),
  }),
};

await ratelimit.free.limit(ip);
// or for a paid user you might have an email or userId available:
await ratelimit.paid.limit(userId);
```

## Custom Rates

When we call `limit`, it subtracts 1 from the number of calls/tokens available in
the timeframe by default. But there are use cases where we may want to subtract different
numbers depending on the request.

Consider a case where we receive some input from the user either alone or in batches.
If we want to rate limit based on the number of inputs the user can send, we need a way of
specifying what value to subtract.

This is possible thanks to the `rate` parameter. Simply call the `limit` method like the
following:

```ts
const { success } = await ratelimit.limit("identifier", { rate: batchSize });
```

This way, the algorithm will subtract `batchSize` instead of 1.

## Multi Region

Let's assume you have customers in the US and Europe. In this case you can
create 2 separate global redis databases on [Upstash](https://console.upstash.com)
(one with its primary in US and the other in Europe) and your users will enjoy
the latency of whichever db is closest to them.

Using a single Redis instance with replicas in different regions cannot offer
the same performance as `MultiRegionRatelimit` because all write commands have
to go through the primary, increasing latency in other regions.

Using a single redis instance has the downside of providing low latencies only
to the part of your userbase closest to the deployed db. That's why we also
built `MultiRegionRatelimit` which replicates the state across multiple redis
databases as well as offering lower latencies to more of your users.

`MultiRegionRatelimit` does this by checking the current limit in the closest db
and returning immediately. Only afterwards will the state be asynchronously
replicated to the other databases leveraging
[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type). Due
to the nature of distributed systems, there is no way to guarantee the set
ratelimit is not exceeded by a small margin. This is the tradeoff for reduced
global latency.

### Usage

The API is the same, except for asking for multiple redis instances:

```ts
import { MultiRegionRatelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit"; // for deno: see above
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

// Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
const ratelimit = new MultiRegionRatelimit({
  redis: [
    new Redis({
      /* auth */
    }),
    new Redis({
      /* auth */
    }),
    new Redis({
      /* auth */
    }),
  ],
  limiter: MultiRegionRatelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"),
  analytics: true,
});

// Use a constant string to limit all requests with a single ratelimit
// Or use a userID, apiKey or ip address for individual limits.
const identifier = "api";
const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(identifier);
```

### Asynchronous synchronization between databases

The MultiRegion setup will do some synchronization between databases after
returning the current limit. This can lead to problems on Cloudflare Workers and
therefore Vercel Edge functions, because dangling promises must be taken care
of:

```ts
const { pending } = await ratelimit.limit("id");
context.waitUntil(pending);
```

See more information on `context.waitUntil` at
[Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#waituntil)
and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#waituntil).
You can also utilize [`waitUntil` from Vercel Functions API](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/functions-api-reference#waituntil).
