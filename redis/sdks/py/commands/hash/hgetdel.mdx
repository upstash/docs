title: HGETDEL
description: Get and delete hash fields atomically.
---

The `HGETDEL` command returns the values of the specified fields and then atomically deletes them from the hash. This is useful when you need to retrieve and remove data in a single atomic operation.

## Arguments

<ParamField body="key" type="str" required>
  The key of the hash.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="fields" type="*List[str]" required>
  One or more field names to get and delete.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField type="Optional[List[str | None]]">
  A list of values corresponding to the requested fields, in the same order as the field arguments. For fields that do not exist, `None` is returned in that position. If the hash doesn't exist, `None` is returned.
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>
```py Basic Example
# Set some hash fields
redis.hset("user:123", values={
    "name": "John",
    "age": "30",
    "email": "john@example.com"
})

# Get and delete specific fields
result = redis.hgetdel("user:123", "name", "email")
assert result == ["John", "john@example.com"]

# Verify fields were deleted
assert redis.hget("user:123", "name") is None
```

```py Multiple Fields
redis.hset("session:abc", values={
    "token": "xyz123",
    "user": "john",
    "expires": "2024-12-31"
})

# Get and delete all fields
session = redis.hgetdel("session:abc", "token", "user", "expires")
assert session == ["xyz123", "john", "2024-12-31"]
```

```py Non-existent Fields
redis.hset("user:456", "name", "Jane")

# Get and delete with non-existent field
result = redis.hgetdel("user:456", "name", "email")
assert result == ["Jane", None]
```

```py Non-existent Hash
# Returns None if hash doesn't exist
result = redis.hgetdel("nonexistent", "field1")
assert result is None
```
</RequestExample>

## Use Cases

- **Session Management**: Retrieve and invalidate session data atomically
- **Cache Cleanup**: Get cached data while removing it from storage
- **Queue Processing**: Fetch and remove job data in a single operation
- **Temporary Data**: Retrieve one-time use tokens or codes while deleting them

<Note>
This command is available in Redis 8.0.0 and later.
