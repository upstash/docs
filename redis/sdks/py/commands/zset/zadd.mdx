```py Simple
# Add three elements
assert redis.zadd("myset", {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "three": 3
}) == 3

# No element is added since "one" and "two" already exist
assert redis.zadd("myset", {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2
}, nx=True) == 0

# New element is not added since it does not exist
assert redis.zadd("myset", {
    "new-element": 1
}, xx=True) == 0

# Only "three" is updated since new score was greater
assert redis.zadd("myset", {
    "three": 10, "two": 0
}, gt=True) == 1

# Only "three" is updated since new score was greater
