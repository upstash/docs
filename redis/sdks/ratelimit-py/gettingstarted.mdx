## Install

```bash
pip install upstash-ratelimit
```

## Create database

To be able to use upstash-ratelimit, you need to create a database on
[Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/).

## Usage

For possible Redis client configurations, have a look at the
[Redis SDK repository](https://github.com/upstash/redis-python).

> This library supports asyncio as well. To use it, import the asyncio-based
> variant from the `upstash_ratelimit.asyncio` module.

```python
from upstash_ratelimit import Ratelimit, FixedWindow
from upstash_redis import Redis

# Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
    redis=Redis.from_env(),
    limiter=FixedWindow(max_requests=10, window=10),
    # Optional prefix for the keys used in Redis. This is useful
    # if you want to share a Redis instance with other applications
    # and want to avoid key collisions. The default prefix is
    # "@upstash/ratelimit"
    prefix="@upstash/ratelimit",
)

# Use a constant string to limit all requests with a single ratelimit
# Or use a user ID, API key or IP address for individual limits.
identifier = "api"
response = ratelimit.limit(identifier)

if not response.allowed:
    print("Unable to process at this time")
else:
    do_expensive_calculation()
    print("Here you go!")
```

The `limit` method also returns the following metadata:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class Response:
    allowed: bool
    """
    Whether the request may pass(`True`) or exceeded the limit(`False`)
    """

    limit: int
    """
    Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.
    """

    remaining: int
    """
    How many requests the user has left within the current window.
    """

    reset: float
    """
    Unix timestamp in seconds when the limits are reset
    """
```
