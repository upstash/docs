## Disable automatic serialization

Your data is (de)serialized as `json` by default. This works for most use cases
but you can disable it if you want:

```ts
const redis = new Redis({
  // ...
  automaticDeserialization: false,
});

// or
const redis = Redis.fromEnv({
  automaticDeserialization: false,
});
```

This probably breaks quite a few types, but it's a first step in that direction.
Please report bugs and broken types
[here](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/issues/49).

## Keep-Alive

`@upstash/redis` optimizes performance by reusing connections wherever possible, reducing latency.
This is achieved by keeping the client in memory instead of reinitializing it with each new function invocation.
As a result, when a hot lambda function receives a new request, it uses the already initialized client, allowing for the reuse of existing connections to Upstash.

<Tip>This functionality is enabled by default.</Tip>

## Request Timeout

You can configure the SDK so that it will throw an error if the request takes longer than a specified time.

You can achieve this using the signal parameter like this:

```ts
try {
  const redis = new Redis({
    url: "<UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>",
    token: "<UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>",
    // set a timeout of 1 second
    signal: () => AbortSignal.timeout(1000),
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === "TimeoutError") {
    console.error("Request timed out");
  } else {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  }
}
```

## Telemetry

This library sends anonymous telemetry data to help us improve your experience.
We collect the following:

- SDK version
- Platform (Deno, Cloudflare, Vercel)
- Runtime version (node@18.x)

You can opt out by setting the `UPSTASH_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable
to any truthy value.

```sh
UPSTASH_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

Alternatively, you can pass `enableTelemetry: false` when initializing the Redis client:

```ts
const redis = new Redis({
  // ...,
  enableTelemetry: false,
});
```
