title: XTRIM
description: Trims the stream by removing entries to keep it at a reasonable size.
---

## Arguments

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the stream.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField body="strategy" type="'MAXLEN' | 'MINID'" required>
      The trimming strategy:
      - `MAXLEN`: Trim based on the maximum number of entries
      - `MINID`: Trim based on the minimum ID
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="threshold" type="number | string" required>
      The threshold value for trimming:
      - For `MAXLEN`: The maximum number of entries to keep (number)
      - For `MINID`: The minimum ID to keep (string). Entries with IDs lower than this will be removed
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="exactness" type="'~' | '='">
      Use `~` for approximate trimming (more efficient, default) or `=` for exact trimming.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="limit" type="number">
      Limit how many entries will be trimmed at most (only valid with approximate trimming `~`).
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField type="number">
  The number of entries removed from the stream.
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>
```ts Approximate trim by max length
const result = await redis.xtrim("mystream", {
  strategy: "MAXLEN",
  threshold: 100,
  exactness: "~"
});
```

```ts Exact trim by max length
const result = await redis.xtrim("mystream", {
  strategy: "MAXLEN", 
  threshold: 50,
  exactness: "="
});
```

```ts Trim by minimum ID
const result = await redis.xtrim("mystream", {
  strategy: "MINID",
  threshold: "1638360173533-0",
  exactness: "="
});
```

```ts Approximate trim with limit
const result = await redis.xtrim("mystream", {
  strategy: "MAXLEN",
  threshold: 1000,
  exactness: "~",
  limit: 100
});
```
