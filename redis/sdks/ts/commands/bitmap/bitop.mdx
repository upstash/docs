The `BITOP` command in Redis is used to perform bitwise operations on multiple keys (or Redis strings) and store the result in a destination key. It is primarily used for performing logical AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on binary data stored in Redis.


## Arguments

<ParamField body="operation" type="AND | OR | XOR | NOT" required>
   Specifies the type of bitwise operation to perform, which can be one of the following: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, or `NOT`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="destinationKey" type="string" required>
    The key to store the result of the operation in.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sourceKeys" type="...string[]" required >
    One or more keys to perform the operation on.
    </ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField type="integer" required>
  The size of the string stored in the destination key.
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>
```ts Example
 await redis.bitop("AND", "destKey", "sourceKey1", "sourceKey2");
```
