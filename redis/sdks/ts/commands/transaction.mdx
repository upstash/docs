You can use transactions or pipelines with the `multi` or `pipeline` method.

Transactions are executed atomically, while pipelines are not. In pipelines you can execute multiple commands at once, but other commands from other clients can be executed in between.

<CodeGroup>

```ts Transaction
const tx = redis.multi();
tx.set("foo", "bar");
tx.get("foo");
const res = await tx.exec();
```

</CodeGroup>

For more information on pipelines and transactions, see
[the Pipeline page](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/ts/pipelining/pipeline-transaction).
