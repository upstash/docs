title: Prod Pack & Enterprise
---


Upstash has Prod Pack and Enterprise plans for customers with critical production workloads. Prod Pack and Enterprise plans include additional monitoring and security features in addition to higher capacity limits and more powerful resources

Prod Pack -> Per database

Enterprise contract -> Per account

Prod Pack are an add-on per database available to both pay-as-you-go and fixed-price plans, not per account. You can have databases on different plans in the same account and each is charged separately. Meanwhile, Enterprise plans are per account, not per database. All of your databases can be included in the same Enterprise plan covering all of your databases.

All features of Prod Pack and Enterprise plan for Upstash Redis are detailed below.

## How to Upgrade

You can activate Prod Pack on the database details page in the [Upstash Console](https://upstash.com/dashboard/redis). For the Enterprise plan, please create a request through the or contact [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).

# Prod Pack Features
These features are available on databases with Prod Pack.

### Uptime SLA
All Prod Pack databases come with an SLA guaranteeing 99.99% uptime. For mission-critical data where uptime is crucial, we recommend Prod Pack plans. Learn more about [Uptime SLA](/common/help/sla).

### SOC-2 Type 2 Compliance & Report
Upstash Redis is SOC-2 Type 2 compliant with Prod Pack. Once you enable Prod Pack, you can request access to the report by going to [Upstash Trust Center](https://trust.upstash.com/) or contacting [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).

### RBAC
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that manages database access. You can create multiple users with different roles to control their actions on your databases.

We recommend using RBAC if your database is accessible to multiple developers.

### High Availability for Read Regions

With Prod Pack add-on, read regions of your database are [highly available](/redis/features/replication#high-availability). This ensures that if one read replica fails, you can read from another read replica in the same region without any additional latency.

### More Backup Capability

Backups up to 3 days are possible with the Prod Pack add-on.

### Encryption at Rest

Encrypts the block storage where your data is persisted and stored.

### Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system widely used for monitoring and alerting in cloud-native and containerized environments.

Upstash Prod Pack and Enterprise plans offer Prometheus metrics collection, enabling you to monitor your Redis databases with Prometheus in addition to console metrics. Learn more about [Prometheus integration](/redis/integrations/prometheus).

### Datadog Integration

Upstash Prod Pack and Enterprise plans include integration with Datadog, allowing you to monitor your Redis databases with Datadog in addition to console metrics. Learn more about [Datadog integration](/redis/howto/datadog).

### More metrics on the Console

Max interval of the metrics that are available on the Upstash Console increases from one week to one month for databases with Prod Pack.
