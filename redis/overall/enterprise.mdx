title: Prod Pack & Enterprise
---


Upstash has Prod Pack and Enterprise plans for customers with critical production workloads. Prod Pack and Enterprise plans include additional monitoring and security features in addition to higher capacity limits and more powerful resources

Prod Pack -> Per database

Enterprise contract -> Per account

Prod Pack are an add-on per database available to both pay-as-you-go and fixed-price plans, not per account. You can have databases on different plans in the same account and each is charged separately. Meanwhile, Enterprise plans are per account, not per database. All of your databases can be included in the same Enterprise plan covering all of your databases.


## Prod Pack Features
These features are available on Prod Pack databases.

### Uptime SLA
All Prod Pack databases come with an SLA guaranteeing 99.99% uptime. For mission-critical data where uptime is crucial, we recommend Prod Pack plans.

### RBAC
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that manages database access. You can create multiple users with different roles to control their actions on your databases.

We recommend using RBAC if your database is accessible to multiple developers.

### SOC-2 Type 2 Report
We have a SOC 2 Type 2 report available for our Prod Pack and Enterprise plans. You can request access to the report by contacting [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).

### Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system widely used for monitoring and alerting in cloud-native and containerized environments.

Upstash Prod Pack and Enterprise plans offer Prometheus metrics collection, enabling you to monitor your Redis databases with Prometheus in addition to console metrics.

### Datadog Integration

Upstash Prod Pack and Enterprise plans include integration with Datadog, allowing you to monitor your Redis databases with Datadog in addition to console metrics.


## Enterprise Features

All Prod Pack features can be included in the Enterprise plan upon request. Additionally, Enterprise plans include:

### Professional Support
All of the databases in the Enterprise plan get access to our professional support. The plan includes response time SLAs and priority access to our support team. Check out the [support page](https://upstash.com/docs/common/help/prosupport) for more details.


The below features are available upon request for Enterprise customers.

### SSO
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows you to use your existing identity provider to authenticate users for your Upstash account. This feature is available upon request for Enterprise customers.

### VPC Peering and Private Links
VPC Peering and Private Links enable you to connect your databases to your VPCs and other private networks, enhancing isolation and security while reducing data transfer costs. This feature is available upon request for Enterprise customers.


### Configurable Backups
Hourly backups with customizable retention are available upon request for Enterprise customers.

### Access Logs
Enterprise customers can request access logs to the databases.

### More Resources
A non-Enterprise Upstash account can create up to 100 databases and 10 teams. Enterprise customers can request more resources.

### HIPAA Compliance
HIPAA reports are available with our Enterprise plans, along with the SOC 2 Type 2 report. To request access, please contact [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com).
