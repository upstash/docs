title: Credential Protection
---

Credential Protection prevents your database credentials from being stored anywhere in Upstash infrastructure, enhancing security by ensuring sensitive credentials are only accessible to you.

<Note>
  Credential Protection is a [Production
  Pack](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/enterprise#prod-pack-features)
  feature.
</Note>

## How It Works

When enabled:

- Redis database credentials are no longer stored in Upstash infrastructure
- Credentials are displayed only once during enablement - save them immediately
- Console features requiring database access are disabled (CLI, Data Browser, Monitor, RBAC)
- API access remains unaffected

## Managing Credential Protection

1. Go to database details page â†’ Configuration section
2. Toggle **Protect Credentials** switch

  />
</Frame>

3. Save the credentials shown in the modal immediately

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/credential-protection/save-credentials.png" width="520" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Disabling this feature will permanently revoke current credentials and
  generate new ones, potentially breaking applications using those credentials.
</Warning>

## What If You Lose Your Credentials

**Reset Credentials**: This function remains available and, when credential protection is enabled, will generate new protected credentials.
