title: Credential Protection
---

Enabling Credential Protection ensures your database credentials are never stored within Upstash infrastructure. This enhances security by making credentials accessible only once—at the moment they are generated.

<Note>
  Credential Protection is a [Production
  Pack](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/enterprise#prod-pack-features)
  feature.
</Note>

## How It Works

When enabled:

- Redis database credentials are no longer stored in Upstash infrastructure
- Credentials are displayed only once during enablement - save them immediately
- Console features requiring database access are disabled (CLI, Data Browser, Monitor, RBAC)

## Managing Credential Protection

1. Go to database details page → Configuration section
2. Toggle **Protect Credentials** switch:

</Frame>

3. Save the credentials shown in the modal:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/credential-protection/save-credentials.png" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Disabling this feature will permanently revoke current credentials and
  generate new ones, potentially breaking applications using those credentials.
</Warning>

## What If You Lose Your Credentials

**Reset Credentials**: This function remains available and, when credential protection is enabled, will generate new protected credentials.
