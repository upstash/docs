title: Backup/Restore
---

You can create backups of your Redis database and restore them when needed. Backups allow you to preserve your data and recover it to any database in your account or team.

## Creating a Backup

<Info>
  During a backup operation, certain administrative operations will be temporarily unavailable: Backup operations, database config changes, plan and region setup, transferring database.
  Regular Redis commands (GET, SET, etc.) are not blocked and continue to work normally.
</Info>

There are two ways to create a backup of your database:

### Create an Immediate Backup

To create a backup right now:

- Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
- Click on the `Backup & Export` button
- Choose `Backup`

</Frame>

Backup process will start and will appear in the backups table below.

### Schedule Periodic Backups

To automatically create backups on a regular schedule:

- Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
- Click the switch next to `Daily Backup` to enable daily backup or click on `Daily Backup` text itself to select how long the backup is to be stored (1 or 3 days)

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/backuprestore/daily-backup-toggle.png" width="800" />
</Frame>

With daily backups enabled, your database will be automatically backed up every day.

### Managing Backups

All created backups are displayed in the backups table in the `Backups` tab. From this table, you can:

- View backup details (name, creation date, size)
- Restore your database from any backup
- Delete backups you no longer need

## Restoring from Backup

<Warning>
  All existing data in the target database will be deleted before the restore operation begins.
</Warning>

You can restore your database from any backup in your account or team.

### Restore from the Backups Table

To restore from a backup of the current database:

- Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
- Find the backup you want to restore in the backups table
- Click on the `Restore` button next to the backup
- Confirm that you are deleting existing data and want to proceed with the restore

### Restore from Any Database Backup

To restore from a backup created from any database in your account or team:

- Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
- Click on the `Restore...` button
- Select the source database (the database from which the backup was created)
- Select the backup you want to restore
- Click on `Start Restore`

### Restore from the Redis List Page

You can also restore databases directly from the Redis list page. This method is explained in detail in the [Import/Export documentation](/redis/howto/importexport).
