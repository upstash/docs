title: Managing Healthcare Data
---

You can use Upstash Redis to store and process Protected Health Information (PHI). You are responsible for the following:

- **Signing a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with Upstash. Email [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) to get started.
- **Marking specific databases as HIPAA databases** and addressing security issues raised by the advisor.
- **Ensuring MFA is enabled** on all Upstash accounts.
  - Enforce MFA as a requirement to access the organization
- **Enabling Prod Pack** which provides encryption at rest and advanced security features.
- **Enabling Credential Protection** to prevent storing credentials in Upstash infrastructure and limit console access requiring database credentials.
- **Configuring IP allowlist** to restrict database access to authorized networks.
- **Enabling daily backups** to validate recoverability and meet retention requirements.
- **Complying with encryption requirements** in the HIPAA Security Rule. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit by Upstash. You can consider encrypting the data at your application layer.
- **Ensuring that PHI is stored only within your database**. Storing PHI in resource names or other locations is strictly prohibited.
- **Ensuring that PHI is stored only in values of data structures, not in identifiers or keys**. Avoid logging keys anywhere.
- **Not using public endpoints** to process PHI.
- **Not transferring databases** to a non-HIPAA organization.
