title: Shared Responsibility Model
---

The Shared Responsibility Model defines the security and operational responsibilities between Upstash and our customers when using Upstash Redis. This model ensures clarity in who is responsible for what aspects of security, compliance, and operations.

## Overview

Upstash Redis is a serverless database service that provides Redis® API compatibility with automatic scaling, high availability, and enterprise-grade security features. The shared responsibility model divides responsibilities into three main categories:

- **Upstash Responsibilities**: Infrastructure, platform, and service-level security
- **Customer Responsibilities**: Data, application, and access management
- **Shared Responsibilities**: Configuration, monitoring, and incident response

## Responsibility Matrix

| Category | Upstash | Customer | Shared |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Infrastructure Security** | ✅ Physical security, network infrastructure, DDoS protection, hardware maintenance | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Platform Security** | ✅ OS security, Redis updates, container security, infrastructure monitoring | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Service Availability** | ✅ 99.99% SLA (Prod Pack), multi-region replication, auto-scaling, disaster recovery | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Data Encryption** | ✅ TLS in transit, encryption at rest (Prod Pack), key management | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Compliance** | ✅ SOC 2 (Prod Pack), GDPR, HIPAA (Enterprise) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Data Management** | ❌ | ✅ Data classification, retention policies, quality controls | ❌ |
| **Application Security** | ❌ | ✅ Secure development, input validation, authentication, client-side encryption | ❌ |
| **Access Control** | ❌ | ✅ Redis ACL, user permissions, credential management, MFA | ❌ |
| **Network Security** | ❌ | ✅ IP allowlist, network segmentation, client security | ❌ |
| **Security Configuration** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ ACL setup, security policies |
| **Monitoring** | ✅ Infrastructure monitoring, incident response | ✅ Application monitoring, custom metrics | ✅ Performance monitoring, security monitoring |
| **Incident Response** | ✅ Infrastructure incidents, service restoration | ✅ Application incidents, data incidents | ✅ Incident coordination, root cause analysis |
