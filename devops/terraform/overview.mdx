The Upstash Terraform Provider lets you manage Upstash Redis resources programmatically.

You can find the Github Repository for the Terraform Provider [here](https://github.com/upstash/terraform-provider-upstash).

## Installation

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    upstash = {
      source = "upstash/upstash"
      version = "x.x.x"
    }
  }
}

provider "upstash" {
  email    = var.email
  api_key  = var.api_key
}
```

`email` is your registered email in Upstash.

`api_key` can be generated from Upstash Console. For more information please check our [docs](https://docs.upstash.com/howto/developerapi).

## Create Database Using Terraform

Here example code snippet that creates database:

```hcl
resource "upstash_redis_database" "redis" {
  database_name = "db-name"
  region        = "eu-west-1"
  tls           = "true"
  multi_zone    = "false"
}
```

## Import Resources From Outside of Terraform

To import resources created outside of the terraform provider, simply create the resource in .tf file as follows:

```hcl
resource "upstash_redis_database" "redis" {}
```

after this, you can run the command:

```
terraform import upstash_redis_database.redis <db-id>
```

Above example is given for an Upstash Redis database. You can import all of the resources by changing the resource type and providing the resource id.
