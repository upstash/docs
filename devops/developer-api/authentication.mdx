The Upstash API requires API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and
manage API keys at the Upstash Console.

Upstash API uses HTTP Basic authentication. You should pass `EMAIL` and
`API_KEY` as basic authentication username and password respectively.

With a client such as `curl`, you can pass your credentials with the `-u`
option, as the following example shows:

```curl
curl https://api.upstash.com/v2/redis/database -u EMAIL:API_KEY
```

Replace `EMAIL` and `API_KEY` with your email and API key.
