title: Resumable Query
---

The resumable query feature allows you to perform queries that can be resumed to fetch additional results. This is particularly useful for large result sets or when implementing pagination.

## Synchronous Usage

### Creating a Resumable Query

To create a resumable query, use the `resumable_query` method of the `Index` class:

```python
query = index.resumable_query(
    vector=[0.1, 0.2],  # or use 'data' parameter for text-based queries
    top_k=2,
    include_metadata=True,
    include_vectors=True,
    namespace="your_namespace"
)
```

Parameters:

- vector: A list of floats representing the query vector.
- data: A string for text-based queries (mutually exclusive with vector).
- top_k: The number of results to fetch initially.
- include_metadata: Whether to include metadata in the results.
- include_vectors: Whether to include vector values in the results.
- max-idle: The maximum idle time for the query in seconds.
- namespace: The namespace to query (optional).

### Starting the Query

To start the query and get initial results:

```python
initial_results = query.start()
```

The initial_results will be a list of result objects, each having properties like
id and metadata (if included).

### Fetching More Results

To fetch additional results:

```python
  next_results = query.fetch_next(number_of_results)
```

This method returns a list of additional results. If no more results are available,
it returns an empty list.

### Stopping the Query

When you're done with the query, stop it to release resources:

```python
  stop_result = query.stop() assert stop_result == 'Success'
```

### Asynchronous Usage

For asynchronous operations, use the AsyncIndex class:

#### Creating an Async Resumable Query

```python
  query = await async_index.resumable_query( vector=[0.1, 0.2], top_k=2,
  include_metadata=True, include_vectors=True, namespace='your_namespace' )
```

#### Starting the Async Query

```python
  initial_results = await query.async_start()
```

#### Fetching More Results Asynchronously

```python
  next_results = await query.async_fetch_next(number_of_results)
```

#### Stopping the Async Query

```python
  stop_result = await query.async_stop() assert stop_result == 'Success'
```

#### Error Handling

After stopping a query, attempting to fetch more results or stop it again will raise a `ClientError`:

```python
  with pytest.raises(ClientError): query.fetch_next(1) # or await
  query.async_fetch_next(1) for async with pytest.raises(ClientError):
  query.stop() # or await query.async_stop() for async
```

Example: Fetching All Results Here's an example of how to fetch all results using
a resumable query:

```python
  query = index.resumable_query(vector=[0.1, 0.2], top_k=2,
  include_metadata=True) results = query.start() while True: next_batch =
  query.fetch_next(2) if not next_batch: break results.extend(next_batch)
  query.stop()
```

This pattern allows you to efficiently retrieve large result sets without loading
everything into memory at once.

<Note>
  Remember to always stop your query when you're done to release server-side
  resources.
</Note>

### Example

```python
from upstash_vector import Index

# Create an index instance
index = Index()

# Upsert vectors into the index
index.upsert(
    vectors=[
        ("id1", [0.1, 0.2], {"field": "value1"}),
        ("id2", [0.3, 0.4], {"field": "value2"}),
        ("id3", [0.5, 0.6], {"field": "value3"}),
    ],
    namespace="example-namespace"
)

# Start a resumable query
query = index.resumable_query(
    vector=[0.1, 0.2],
    top_k=2,
    include_metadata=True,
    include_vectors=True,
    namespace="example-namespace"
)

# Fetch initial results
results = query.start()

# Access result data
for result in results:
    print(f"ID: {result.id}, Metadata: {result.metadata}")

# Stop the query when done
query.stop()
```
