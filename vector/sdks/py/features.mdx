# Retry Mechanism

The `upstash-vector` SDK incorporates a reliable retry mechanism to manage network or API issues.
In the event of a failed request, the SDK automatically attempts up to three retries,
with each attempt spaced one second apart.

For customization of the retry behavior, you have the flexibility to set the `retries` and
`retry_interval` (in seconds) parameters according to your specific requirements.
For instance:

```python
from upstash_vector import Index

# Try 5 times with a 2-second interval between retries
index = Index.from_env(retries=5, retry_interval=2.0)
```

# Telemetry

This library sends anonymous telemetry data to help us improve your experience.
We collect the following:

- SDK version
- Platform (Vercel, AWS)
- Python Runtime version

You can opt out by passing `allow_telemetry=False` when initializing the Redis client:

```py
idx = Index("INDEX_URL", "INDEX_TOKEN", allow_telemetry=False)
```
