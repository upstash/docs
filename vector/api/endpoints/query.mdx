title: "Query Vectors"
description: "This endpoint queries a given vector over the existing vectors in the index."
api: "POST https://{endpoint}/query"
authMethod: "bearer"
---

## Request

<ParamField body="vector" name="vector" type="number[]" required>
  The query vector
  <Note>
    The provided vector should have the same number of dimensions as your
    index.
  </Note>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="topK" type="number" required>
  The total number of the vectors that you want to receive as a query
  result. The response will be sorted based on the distance metric score,
  and `topK` vectors will be returned.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="includeMetadata" type="boolean">
  Whether to include the metadata of the vectors in the response. Setting
  this `true` would be the best practice, since it will make it easier to
  identify the vectors.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="includeVectors" type="boolean">
  Whether to include the vector data of the resulting vectors.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="filter" type="string">
  Metadata filter to apply (See [Metadata Filtering](/vector/features/filtering))
</ParamField>

## Response

<Note>
  The score is normalized to always be between 0 and 1. The closer the score is to 1, the more similar the vector is to the query vector.
  This does not depend on the distance metric you use.
</Note>

<ResponseField name="Response" type="Array">
  <Expandable defaultOpen="true">
    <ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
      The ID of the resulting vector.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="score" type="number" required>
      The score of the vector data, calculated based on the distance metric of your index.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="vector" type="number[]">
      The resulting vector data.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="metadata" type="Object">
      Whether to include the vector values of the resulting vector objects.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
