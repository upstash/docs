## Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search


The primary functionality of the vector store is straightforward: identifying the most similar vectors to a given vector. 
While the concept is simple, translating it into a practical product poses significant challenges.

A simple and basic approach to searching in a vector database is to perform an exhaustive search by comparing a query vector to every other vector stored in the database one by one. However, this consumes too many resources and results in very high latencies, making it not very practical. To address this problem, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (`ANN`) algorithms are used. `ANN` search approximates the true nearest neighbor, which means it might not find the absolute closest point, but it will find one that's close enough, with a **low-latency** and by consuming **fewer resources**.
In the literature, the comparison of the results of `ANNS` with exhaustive search is called the recall rate.
 The higher the recall rate the better the results.

Several `ANNS` algorithms, such as `HNSW`[1], `NSG`[2], and `DiskANN`[3], are available for use, 
each with its distinct characteristics. One of the difficult problems in ANN algorithms is that indexing and querying vectors may require storing the whole data in memory. When the dataset is huge, then memory requirements for indexing may exceed available memory. `DiskANN` algorithm tries to solve this problem by using disk as the main storage for indexes and for performing queries directly on disk.`DiskANN` paper acknowledges that, if you try to store your vectors 
in disk and use  `HNSW` or `NSG`, you may end up with again very high latencies. `DiskANN` is focused 
on serving queries from disk with **low-latency** and **good recall rate**. 
And this helps Upstash Vector to be **cost-effective**, therefore cheaper compared to alternatives.

Even though `DiskANN` has its advantages, it also requires more work to be practical. 
Main problem is that, you can't  insert/update existing index without reindexing all the vectors. 
For this problem, there is another improved  paper `FreshDiskANN`[4]. `FreshDiskANN` improves `DiskANN` via introducing
a temporary index for up-to-date data in memory. Queries are served from both the temporary(up-to-date) index 
and also from the disk. And these temporary indexes are merged to the disk from time-to-time behind the scene. 

Upstash Vector is based on `DiskANN` and  `FreshDiskANN` with more improvements based on our 
tests and observations.

## Vector Similarity Functions

When creating a vector index in Upstash Vector, you have the flexibility to choose from different vector similarity functions. 
Each function yields distinct query results, catering to specific use cases. Here are the three supported similarity functions:

<Note>
  The score returned from query requests is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest similarity and 0 the lowest regardless of the similarity function used.
</Note>

#### Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It is particularly useful when the magnitude of the vectors is not essential, and the focus is on the orientation. 

**Use Cases:**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Ideal for comparing document embeddings or word vectors, as it captures semantic similarity irrespective of vector magnitude.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Effective in recommending items based on user preferences or content similarities.

**Score calculation:**
``` (1 + cosine_similarity(v1, v2)) / 2;```

#### Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance calculates the straight-line distance between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It is well-suited for scenarios where the magnitude of vectors is crucial, providing a measure of their spatial separation.

**Use Cases:**
- **Computer Vision:** Useful in image processing tasks, such as image recognition or object detection, where the spatial arrangement of features is significant.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Valuable for detecting anomalies in datasets, as it considers both the direction and magnitude of differences between vectors.

**Score calculation:**
```1 / (1 + squared_distance(v1, v2))```

</Frame>

#### Dot Product

The dot product measures the similarity by multiplying the corresponding components of two vectors and summing the results. It provides a measure of alignment between vectors.
Note that to use dot product, the vectors needs to be normalized to be of unit length. 

**Use Cases:**
- **Machine Learning Models:** Commonly used in machine learning for tasks like sentiment analysis or classification, where feature alignment is critical.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Effective in collaborative filtering scenarios, such as recommending items based on user behavior or preferences.

**Score calculation:**
``` (1 + dot_product(v1, v2)) / 2```

## Metadata

Metadata feature allows you to store context with your vectors to make a connection. 
There can be a couple of uses of this: 
1. You can put the source of the vector in the metadata to use in your application from the query response.
2. You can put some metadata to further filter the results upon the query. We will have more advanced filtering using this 
metadata soon. 

You can set metadata with your vector as follows:

```shell
curl https://powerful-kodiak-60521-us1-vector.upstash.io/upsert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
   "id":"4",
   "vector":[0.9215,0.3897,....],
   "metadata":{
      "url":"https://imgur.com/z9AVZLb"
   }
}' 
```

When you do a query or fetch, you can opt-in to retrieve the metadata as follows:

- **Query Example**

```shell
curl https://powerful-kodiak-60521-us1-vector.upstash.io/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
   "vector":[0.9215,0.3897,...],
   "topK" : 5,
   "includeMetadata": true
}' 
```

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "1", 
      "score": 1,
      "metadata": {
        "url": "https://imgur.com/z9AVZLb"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "3", 
      "score": 0.99961007,
      "metadata": {
        "url": "https://imgur.com/zfOPmnI"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Range Example**

```shell
curl https://powerful-kodiak-60521-us1-vector.upstash.io/range \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{ "cursor" : "",  "limit" : 3, "includeMetadata": true}' 
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "nextCursor": "4",
    "vectors": [
      {"id": "1", "metadata": {"url": "https://imgur.com/z9AVZLb"}},
      {"id": "2", "metadata": {"url": "https://imgur.com/a2nCEIt"}},
      {"id": "3", "metadata": {"url": "https://imgur.com/zfOPmnI"}}
    ]
  }
}
```
