title: MongoDB Sink Connector


---

MongoDB Sink Connector allows you to continuously store the data appears in your
Kafka Topics to MongoDB database. In this guide, we will walk you through
creating DB Sink Connector with MongoDB database to Upstash Kafka.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
    If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
    steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the **New
Connector** button.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Choose **MongoDB Connector Sink**

Enter a connector name and MongoDB URI(connection string). Select single or
multiple topics from existing topics to read data from.

Enter Database and Collection that the selected topics are written into. We
entered "new" as Database and "test" as Collection. It is not required for this
database and collection to exist on MongoDB database. They will be created
automatically.

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector
supports. At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related
documentation. We can proceed with what we have and click the **Connect** button
directly.

Congratulations! You have created your MongoDB Sink Connector. As you put data
into your selected topics, the data will be written into your MongoDB database.
