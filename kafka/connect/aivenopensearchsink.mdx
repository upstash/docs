title: Aiven OpenSearch Sink Connector

<Snippet file="kafka/connector-migration.mdx" />


Aiven OpenSearch Sink Connector allows you to continuously store the data from
your Kafka Topics in any OpenSearch compatible product like Amazon OpenSearch,
Elasticsearch, etc.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating an Aiven OpenSearch Sink
Connector with Elasticsearch.

## Get Started

### Create a Kafka Cluster

<Info>
  If you do not have a Kafka cluster and/or topic already, follow [these
  steps](../overall/getstarted) to create one.
</Info>

### Prepare the Elasticsearch Environment

If you already have an Elasticsearch environment with the following information,
skip this step and continue from the
[Create The Connector](#create-the-connector) section.

- `connection.url`
- `connection.username`
- `connection.password`

Go to [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments) Create or a
deployment. Aside from the name, default configurations should be fine for this
guide.

Don't forget to save the deployment credentials. We need them to create the
connector later.

Lastly, we need the connection endpoint. Click on your deployment to see the
details and click to the "Copy Endpoint" of Elasticsearch in Applications
section.

</Frame>

These three(username, password, and endpoint) should be enough to create the
connector.

### Create the Connector

Go to the Connectors tab, and create your first connector by clicking the **New
Connector** button.

</Frame>

Choose your connector as **Aiven OpenSearch Sink Connector**

<Frame>

</Frame>

Enter the required properties.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/kafka/connect/aiven/opensearch/sink/2config.png" />
</Frame>

The advanced screen is for any other configuration that the selected connector
supports. At the top of this screen, you can find a link to related
documentation. We can proceed with what we have and click the **Connect** button
directly.

</Frame>

Congratulations! You have created an OpenSearch Sink Connector.

As you put data into your selected topics, the data will be written into
ElasticSearch.
