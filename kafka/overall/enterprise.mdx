<Note>
  All Pro/Enterprise plans have multi-replica. Even if your first cluster is
  single-replica, replication is enabled with the upgrade.
</Note>

<Note>
  Pro/Enterprise plans are per cluster (not per account). You can have clusters
  on different plans in the same account and each is charged separately.
  Pro/Enterprise plans have a minimum term of 1 month, afterwards you can cancel
  any time.
</Note>

### How to Upgrade

Apply for an Pro/Enterprise plan in your cluster details page in the console.

### Pro/Enterprise Plans Network & Storage Costs

In Pro/Enterprise plans, in addition to plan price, you will be charged for
storage and network usage costs.

<Note>
  You can enable VPC Peering to minimize network (data transfer) cost. Contact
  us [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

#### Storage Cost

Storage cost calculation is the same as pay-as-you-go plan which
`$0.25 per GB-month`.

Note that the total storage is the sum of storage in all replicas. So 1MB data
will total up to 3MB in a multi replica cluster.

#### Network Cost

Network costs (data transfer prices) are as below:

- Data-in: `$0.1` per GB in.
- Data-out: `$0.05` per GB out.

<Note>
  The above pricing assumes that the clients and cluster are in the same cloud
  provider. If not, you may be charged at a higher rate proportional to what
  cloud providers charge us. Contact us
  [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) for details.
</Note>

| **IP Whitelisting**           | You can set the IP addresses which will have access to your database.                                                                                                               |

| **VPC Peering**               | VPC Peering enables you to connect to Upstash from your own VPC using private IP. Cluster and your application can run in the same subnet which also minimizes data transfer costs. |
| **AWS Private Link**          | AWS Private link helps you to access to Upstash Cluster with a private network link inside AWS infrastructure.                                                                      |
| **Encryption at rest**        | Upstash encrypts the block storage where your data is persisted and stored.                                                                                                         |
| **Professional Support**      | Professional Support includes dedicated service desk and Slack/Discord channel with response time SLAs.                                                                             |
