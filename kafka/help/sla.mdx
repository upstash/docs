title: SLA
---

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") applies to the use of the Upstash services,
offered under the terms of our Terms of Service or other agreement with us
governing your use of Upstash. This SLA does not apply to Upstash services in
the Upstash Free Tier. It is clarified that this SLA is subject to the terms of
the Agreement, and does not derogate therefrom (capitalized terms, unless
otherwise indicated herein, have the meaning specified in the Agreement).
Upstash reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA by publishing updated
terms on its website, such change to be effective as of the date of publication.

### Regional and Global Database SLA

Upstash will use commercially reasonable efforts to make regional and global
databases available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.99%.

In the event any of the services do not meet the SLA, you will be eligible to
receive a Service Credit as described below.

| Monthly Uptime Percentage                           | Service Credit Percentage |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Less than 99.99% but equal to or greater than 99.0% | 10%                       |
| Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0%  | 30%                       |
| Less than 95.0%                                     | 60%                       |

### SLA Credits

Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the monthly bill (excluding
one-time payments such as upfront payments) for the service in the affected
region that did not meet the SLA.

Uptime percentages are recorded and published in the
[Upstash Status Page](https://status.upstash.com).

To receive a Service Credit, you should submit a claim by sending an email to
[support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com). Your credit request should be
received by us before the end of the second billing cycle after the incident
occurred.

We will apply any service credits against future payments for the applicable
services. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card
you used. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment. A
Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the
applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service
Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.
