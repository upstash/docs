title: Compatibility
---

One of the following compatibility rules can be selected when using the Schema Registry:

- `BACKWARD`: consumers using the new schema can read data written by producers using the latest registered schema.
- `BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE`(default): consumers using the new schema can read data written by producers using all previously registered schemas.
- `FORWARD`: consumers using the latest registered schema can read data written by producers using the new schema.
- `FORWARD_TRANSITIVE`: consumers using all previously registered schemas can read data written by producers using the new schema.
- `FULL`: the new schema is forward and backward compatible with the latest registered schema.
- `FULL_TRANSITIVE`: the new schema is forward and backward compatible with all previously registered schemas.
- `NONE`: schema compatibility checks are disabled.

To enable the semantics above, you are allowed to make the following changes in each option.
If you choose `TRANSITIVE`, it means that schema will be compared against all versions before, 
not only the last one. 
The table shows which applications `consumers` / `producers` should be upgraded first.
