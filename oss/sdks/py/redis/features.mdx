### BITFIELD and BITFIELD_RO

One particular case is represented by these two chained commands, which are
available as functions that return an instance of the `BITFIELD` and,
respectively, `BITFIELD_RO` classes. Use the `execute` function to run the
commands.

```python
redis.bitfield("test_key") \
  .incrby(encoding="i8", offset=100, increment=100) \
  .overflow("SAT") \
  .incrby(encoding="i8", offset=100, increment=100) \
  .execute()

redis.bitfield_ro("test_key_2") \
  .get(encoding="u8", offset=0) \
  .get(encoding="u8", offset="#1") \
  .execute()
```

### Custom commands

If you want to run a command that hasn't been implemented, you can use the
`execute` function of your client instance and pass the command as a `list`.

```python
redis.execute(["XLEN", "test_stream"])
```

# Encoding

Although Redis can store invalid JSON data, there might be problems with the
deserialization. To avoid this, the Upstash REST proxy is capable of encoding
the data as base64 on the server and then sending it to the client to be
decoded.

For very large data, this can add a few milliseconds in latency. So, if you're
sure that your data is valid JSON, you can set `rest_encoding` to `None`.

# Retry mechanism

upstash-redis has a fallback mechanism in case of network or API issues. By
default, if a request fails it'll retry once, 3 seconds after the error. If you
want to customize that, set `rest_retries` and `rest_retry_interval` (in
seconds).
