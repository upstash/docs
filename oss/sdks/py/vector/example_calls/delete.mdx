## Method

The `delete` method allows you to remove vectors from the index based on their identifiers. It returns the following field in response:

- `deleted`: An integer indicating how many vectors were deleted with the command.

## Delete Example

```python
from upstash_vector import Index

index = Index.from_env()

# Specify the identifiers of vectors to be deleted
ids_to_delete = ["id1", "id2", "id3"]

# Delete the specified vectors
delete_result = index.delete(ids=ids_to_delete)

# Display the number of vectors deleted
print("Number of Vectors Deleted:", delete_result.deleted)
```

Alternatively, you can delete a singular vector:

```python
index.delete("id-4")
```
