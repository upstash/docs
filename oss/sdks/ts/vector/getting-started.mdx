```shell npm
npm install @upstash/vector
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm add @upstash/vector
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Initializing the client

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash vector client: an REST token and REST URL. These values can be passed using environment variables or in code through a configuration object. Find your configuration values in the console dashboard at [https://console.upstash.com/](https://console.upstash.com/).

#### Using environment variables

The environment variables used to configure the client are the following. You can follow [this guide](/vector/overall/getstarted) to retrieve credentials.

```bash
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

When these environment variables are set, the client constructor does not require any additional arguments.

```typescript
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

const index = new Index();
```

#### Using a configuration object

If you prefer to pass configuration in code, the constructor accepts a config object containing the `url` and `token` values. This
could be useful if your application needs to interact with multiple projects, each with a different configuration.

```typescript
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

const index = new Index({
  url: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL>",
  token: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN>",
});
```

## TypeScript Usage

### Index level types
The Vector SDK supports defining your metadata type at the index level for complete type-safety.

```typescript
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

type Metadata = { genre: string, year: number };

const index = new Index<Metadata>();
```

Passing a metadata type at the index level will provide strong type safety for the metadata coming back from or required for the following commands:
- `query`
- `upsert`
- `fetch`
- `range`

### Command level types

In some cases, you might not want to define a metadata type at the index level. In this case, you can either override the index level type definition for a specific command, or pass a metadata type to specific commands instead.

```typescript
import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

type Metadata = { genre: string, year: number };

const index = new Index();

index.upsert<Metadata>({ id: 1, vector: [...], metadata: { 
  genre: "comedy",
  year: 1990
}});
```

The passing of a strong metadata type is possible for each of the four index operations listed above, we use upsert as an example.
