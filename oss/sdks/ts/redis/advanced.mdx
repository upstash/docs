## Disable automatic serialization

Your data is (de)serialized as `json` by default. This works for most use cases
but you can disable it if you want:

```ts
const redis = new Redis({
  // ...
  automaticDeserialization: false,
});

// or
const redis = Redis.fromEnv({
  automaticDeserialization: false,
});
```

This probably breaks quite a few types, but it's a first step in that direction.
Please report bugs and broken types
[here](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/issues/49).

## Keep-Alive

`@upstash/redis` optimizes performance by reusing connections wherever possible, reducing latency.
This is achieved by keeping the client in memory instead of reinitializing it with each new function invocation.
As a result, when a hot lambda function receives a new request, it uses the already initialized client, allowing for the reuse of existing connections to Upstash.

<Tip>This functionality is enabled by default.</Tip>
