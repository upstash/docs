title: Pipeline & Transaction

### Pipeline

Pipelining commands allows you to send a single http request with multiple
commands. Keep in mind, that the execution of pipelines is not atomic and the
execution of other commands can interleave.

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const redis = new Redis({
  /* auth */
});

const p = redis.pipeline();

// Now you can chain multiple commands to create your pipeline:

p.set("key", 2);
p.incr("key");

// or inline:
p.hset("key2", "field", { hello: "world" }).hvals("key2");

// Execute the pipeline once you are done building it:
// `exec` returns an array where each element represents the response of a command in the pipeline.
// You can optionally provide a type like this to get a typed response.
const res = await p.exec<[Type1, Type2, Type3]>();
```

For more information about pipelines using REST see
[here](https://blog.upstash.com/pipeline).

If you wish to benefit from pipeline automatically,
you can simply enable auto-pipelining to make your redis client
handle the commands in batches in the background. See
[the Auto-pipelining page](https://docs.upstash.com/oss/sdks/ts/redis/pipelining/auto-pipeline).

### Transaction

Remember that the pipeline is able to send multiple commands at once but
can't execute them atomically. With transactions, you can make the commands
execute atomically.

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const redis = new Redis({
  /* auth */
});

const p = redis.multi();

p.set("key", 2);
p.incr("key");

// or inline:
p.hset("key2", "field", { hello: "world" }).hvals("key2");

// execute the transaction
const res = await p.exec<[Type1, Type2, Type3]>();
```
